About Sharp Shot

How is Sharp Shot different from other betting tools?
We scan 40+ sportsbooks in near real time, calculate +EV/middles/arbs, and let you turn filters into reusable Presets. The UI is built like a trading terminal—fast, minimal, and action-first.

Which sports and markets does Sharp Shot cover?
Major U.S. leagues and high-liquidity markets (spreads, totals, moneylines, select props), with more sports added as data quality meets our standards.

Is Sharp Shot legal to use in my state?
Sharp Shot is an analytics tool, not a sportsbook, and is generally legal to use. You’re responsible for local laws and age restrictions.

Betting Concepts

What is implied probability (and why does it matter)?
It converts odds into a percent chance the book is pricing. Comparing that percent to your edge source tells you if a bet is +EV.

What is vig/juice and how does it affect EV?
Vig is the bookmaker’s margin embedded in prices; removing it gives a fair line. EV should be computed against that fair price.

Why can +EV bets lose in the short term (variance)?
+EV wins over many trials, not every bet. Short-term results swing; bankroll management smooths the ride.

What is the Kelly Criterion for bankroll management?
Kelly sizes bets based on edge and odds to maximize long-term growth; many use fractional Kelly to reduce volatility.

Using the Platform

Do you support live/in-game markets?
We focus on pre-game markets today for speed and accuracy. In-game support is on the roadmap once latency and data quality meet our bar.

How do Presets work for private vs public sharing?
Save any filter set as a Preset, then choose private (only you/your team) or public (share with the community). Visibility can be changed later.

Can I invite collaborators to a private preset?
Yes—Pro lets you invite collaborators to private presets; Unlimited removes collaborator limits. The preset stays private to those invited.

Can I set book/market priorities so results match how I bet?
Yes—use Book Priority Sorting and the Preset Editor weighting (Pro and above) to emphasize preferred books/markets.

Pricing and Subscriptions

What’s included in Pro vs Unlimited?
Pro: Auto-Save Last Used Filters, Book Priority Sorting, public preset follower counts, creator bios, Community Highlights, Fork button, and private-preset collaboration. Unlimited: everything in Pro plus unlimited sharing, unlimited collaborators, and priority support.

Can I switch plans or downgrade without losing my presets?
Yes. Your presets remain attached to your account; features that require a higher tier pause until you upgrade again.

Affiliate Program

How do I join the affiliate program and get my link?
Apply via the site or contact support; once approved, you’ll get a dashboard with your unique referral link and tracking.

When are commissions paid, and what counts as an “active user”?
Commissions are calculated monthly and paid on paying subscribers attributed to your link. An active user is billed and in good standing for that period.

Technical and Support

Which browsers are officially supported?
The latest two versions of Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox. For the full terminal experience, use a modern desktop browser.

Why did an opportunity disappear from the terminal?
Lines move quickly; if a price updates or a market is pulled, the opportunity will drop. Refresh or adjust filters to find the next edge.

How do I report an odds discrepancy or a bug?
Send the sport, book, market, timestamp, and a screenshot (if possible) to support@sharpshotcalc.com
 or use the in-app feedback link.

Taxes

Will I receive a 1099-NEC for affiliate earnings?
If your annual affiliate payouts meet IRS thresholds and we have your W-9, we’ll issue a 1099-NEC. Please consult your tax advisor for personal guidance.

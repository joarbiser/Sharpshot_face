Build a high-performance, conversion-focused marketing website for a SaaS web application called Sharp Shot. The platform is a sports betting analytics and strategy tool that helps users find +EV (positive expected value) bets, create shareable betting strategies, track closing line value (CLV), and compare sportsbook odds in real-time.

Sharp Shot is not a sportsbook. It is a calculator and analysis engine for bettors, built with the edge in mind. The site should emphasize credibility, clarity, and precision, with a tone that feels sharp, futuristic, and slightly gamified — similar to modern fintech and analytics tools.

🧠 Brand & Identity Details
Product Name: Sharp Shot
Tagline (headline): It’s not luck. It’s leverage.
Subheadline: Built to make you sharper.
Voice & Tone: Sharp, data-focused, confident, and tactical. Slight gamified energy but never playful or casual. Avoid corporate fluff. Think: “a Bloomberg Terminal for bettors.”
Target Users: Sports bettors who value data, betting content creators, affiliates, and sports analytics enthusiasts. These are edge-seeking users — not casual gamblers.

🎨 Design System (Strict Visual Direction)
Layout Style: Modular, vertical scroll with clean sections. Avoid overwhelming animations. Stick to clarity. Use generous spacing, tight visual hierarchy, and modern responsive containers.

Typography:

Headings: Tungsten or similar bold, techy, condensed sans-serif

Body: Inter, or any clean, modern sans-serif for clarity

Color Palette:

Background: White (#FFFFFF)

Text: Black (#000000)

Accent: Gold (#BA9A5B)

UI Elements / Secondary: Charcoal Gray (#3B3B3D)

Icons and Visual Language: Use line graphs, filters, toggles, EV flags, and abstract dashboards — not traditional betting icons like chips or dice. Lean into sleek interface metaphors and visual motifs of optimization, precision, and edge.

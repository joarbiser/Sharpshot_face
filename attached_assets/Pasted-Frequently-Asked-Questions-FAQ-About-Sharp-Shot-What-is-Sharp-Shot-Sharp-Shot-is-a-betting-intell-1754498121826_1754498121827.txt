Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
About Sharp Shot
What is Sharp Shot?
Sharp Shot is a betting intelligence platform that identifies +EV (positive expected value), arbitrage, and middling opportunities across major sportsbooks. It helps users flip the vig and make data-driven bets with long-term edge.

Who is Sharp Shot built for?
Sharp Shot is built for serious bettors who want to leverage market inefficiencies—whether you're a sharp looking to scale or a disciplined beginner seeking an edge.

Betting Concepts
What is +EV betting?
+EV stands for "positive expected value." It means a bet is mathematically projected to make money over time.

Example:
DraftKings lists a player prop at -120, but five other books list it at -200. Sharp Shot removes the vig, calculates fair odds as around -185, and flags this as a +EV bet with expected edge.

What is arbitrage betting?
Arbitrage betting takes advantage of line discrepancies between sportsbooks to lock in a profit regardless of outcome.

Example:
FanDuel offers Over 1.5 Goals at +110, while BetMGM offers Under 1.5 Goals at +115 for the same match. Sharp Shot shows you exactly how to stake both sides so that no matter the outcome, you lock in a guaranteed profit with zero risk.

What is middling?
Middling is when you bet both sides of a line at different numbers and aim for the final score to land in between — resulting in both bets cashing. Sharp Shot only surfaces middles where your worst-case outcome is break-even and your best-case is a double win.

Example:
DraftKings has Over 41.5 at +120, while FanDuel posts Under 44.5 at -120. Sharp Shot shows you how to stake both sides so that:

If the game lands between 42 and 44, both bets win and you lock in profit

If it lands outside that range, one bet wins and the other loses — but you break even due to the odds
No matter what, you never lose money — you're either neutral or profitable.

Technical and Support
Why am I not seeing any +EV bets right now?
At times, markets are more efficient and high-edge opportunities are rare. Try widening your filters or checking back during high-volume windows like game day mornings or injury news cycles.

Is Sharp Shot mobile-friendly?
Yes. Sharp Shot works on both desktop and mobile browsers. While strategy building is best on desktop, mobile is optimized for scanning and placing bets quickly.

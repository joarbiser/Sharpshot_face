Prompt to Replit:
“Redesign the global background into a futuristic cyber-glow gradient with layered depth. Apply to body and full-screen wrappers only. Keep layout and spacing untouched. Use multiple gradient types (radial, conic, linear) to create distinct shapes and movement.

Light Mode:

Base Layer: A smooth linear gradient running top-left to bottom-right, starting very light (off-white with a cool gray tint) and transitioning to slightly darker cool gray in the lower corner.

Radial Glow Shapes:

Large, soft circular glow in pale blue anchored to the top-right corner, bleeding toward the center.

Medium teal glow set low-left, oval in shape and stretched slightly horizontally, fading outward.

Conic Sweep: A faint conic gradient arc placed diagonally from top-left toward bottom-right, giving the sense of a soft sweep of light across the page.

Gold Accent: A small circular radial gradient in Sharp Shot gold, off-center toward the mid-right edge. It should look like a shimmer or distant spotlight, fading quickly into the background.

Dark Mode:

Base Layer: A deep charcoal-to-navy linear gradient running top to bottom. The top should be darker charcoal, the bottom drifting into navy blue.

Radial Glow Shapes:

Large deep blue radial glow in the bottom-right corner, circular, extending upward.

Teal radial glow positioned top-left, more oval-shaped, angled diagonally.

Conic Sweep: A conic gradient arc spanning across the center diagonally (top-right toward bottom-left). This should create a feeling of subtle energy currents or flowing arcs of light.

Gold Accent: A sharper radial gold glow, smaller and placed slightly off-center near the bottom-middle. It should feel like a metallic glint breaking through the darker tones.

Shared Notes:

Radial shapes should be very soft at the edges—fading seamlessly into the base.

The gold highlight should never dominate—think accent shimmer, not spotlight.

The placement of shapes should feel balanced: one strong glow from each side (blue/teal), with a subtle golden counterpoint.

Overall look: light mode = airy, minimal, futuristic; dark mode = immersive, sleek, terminal-like.”

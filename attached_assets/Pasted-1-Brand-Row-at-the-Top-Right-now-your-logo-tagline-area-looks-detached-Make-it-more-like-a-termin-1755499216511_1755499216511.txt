1. Brand Row at the Top

Right now your logo/tagline area looks detached. Make it more like a terminal prompt:
>_ Sharp Shot on the left, tagline on the right.

Tighten spacing so the brand lockup feels anchored, not floating.

Use the same uppercase/outline style as the nav bar to create continuity.

2. Background & Separation

The footer is blending into the page too much — it feels like just more white space.

Give it a subtle darker panel treatment (light gradient or slightly off-white to gray shift). Not heavy, but enough that it feels like its own module.

Add a thin top divider line in gold to connect it visually with the header.

3. Link Columns

Your columns look too generic. Right now they’re just text lists.

Give each column label a tiny uppercase “system heading” look (tight letter spacing, muted tone).

Add small outline icons to each link like we talked about before — makes them feel like utilities in a dashboard rather than plain website nav.

4. CTA Zone

The “Get Started” button looks like a default form element. That kills the vibe.

Restyle it as a ghost/outline button consistent with your header “access beta” button — outline, subtle hover shimmer, maybe a tiny icon.

“Sign In” should be styled more like a text-link with an underline-on-hover, not a throwaway default.

5. Hierarchy & Balance

Right now, all sections (Product, Resources, Company, Access) have equal weight. That makes it look flat.

De-emphasize secondary links (FAQ, Privacy, etc.) and give slightly more visual weight to Product and Access. Those are your main conversion drivers.

6. Bottom Line

The copyright and “Advanced analytics for sharp minds” lines feel like filler.

Combine them into a single clean closing line, written in your system-prompt style. Example:
© 2025 Sharp Shot › Built for sharp minds.

Keep it centered or aligned left, but don’t spread two different messages across the bar.

7. Micro-Interactions

Add hover effects that mirror the nav:

Links get a subtle underline grow.

Icons glow faintly on hover.

CTA buttons shimmer/pulse lightly when hovered.

This ties the bottom and top together as one cohesive system.

8. Layout Density

Right now it’s very sparse and text is floating in a lot of white space.

Tighten column spacing slightly so it feels more structured, almost like a grid in a terminal window.

Keep breathing room, but don’t let it feel like “empty margins.”

If you do these, the footer will stop looking like a “basic corporate template” and start reading like a system panel that belongs to the same UI as your top bar.

Replit, keep the current structure but layer in clarity, warmth, and small interactions. Do not add heavy visuals.

Page header (tweak copy)

Title stays: Support

Replace the subtext with: Get answers or contact us — whether you’re exploring Sharp Shot or already using it.

Above-form helper band (one line, small, muted)

Add a slim line of text above the form fields:
Not a member yet? Send pre-sales questions to support@sharpshotcalc.com or use the form below.

Make “support@sharpshotcalc.com” a mailto link.

Add a short “Expected response time” note (small, right under the helper)

Copy: Typical response time: within one business day.

Add a “Member status” selector (first field, before Email)

Label: I’m…

Options: A current member; Evaluating Sharp Shot

Required. Use this to route the email subject and auto-suggest a Category later.

Expand Category options to include pre-sales

Keep existing options, and add: Pre-sales / Memberships; General Question

If “Evaluating Sharp Shot” is selected, default the Category to “Pre-sales / Memberships”.

Refine field helper text to feel more human

Subject placeholder: One line that sums it up

Message placeholder: Include what you were trying to do, what happened, and any steps to reproduce. Screenshots help.

Attachment helper (tiny text under the field): Images or PDF, up to 10 MB. Do not include account numbers or personal IDs.

Micro-interactions (keep them subtle, consistent with the site)

On focus: outline inputs with the same soft focus ring you use elsewhere.

On hover for the primary button: the restrained sweep you already use.

For validation: shake is not needed — simply show a clear inline note under the field and highlight the outline.

Secondary contact block (right side on desktop, below form on mobile)

Title (small label): Quick links

Links:
Tutorials
FAQ
Glossary
Memberships
Pricing
Email Support (mailto)

Use the same “utility link” style (muted, underline on hover, small outline icons).

Submit states and success copy (make it friendlier)

While sending: Sending… (keep disabled)

Success banner copy:
Thanks — your request is in. We’ll follow up at <email>. In the meantime, you can check Tutorials or FAQ.
Make “Tutorials” and “FAQ” links.

Error banner copy:
We couldn’t send that. Please try again, or email support@sharpshotcalc.com.

Subject line and body rules (email to Support)

If “A current member” is selected, use subject prefix: [Support]

If “Evaluating Sharp Shot” is selected, use subject prefix: [Pre-sales]

Keep the plain-text body you already defined, same field order. Ensure Reply-To is the user’s email.

Light visual polish (no heavy changes)

Reduce the vertical gap between each label and its field slightly, so the stack feels tighter.

Group Member status, Email, Subject into one logical block with a faint divider below, then Category, Message, Attachment as the second block. This adds structure without visual weight.

Add small outline icons to the left of each field label (mail icon for Email, tag/bookmark for Category, paperclip for Attachment). Icons are muted by default, slightly brighter on focus of their field.

Footer CTA after the form (muted, centered)

Copy: Looking for plan details? Compare memberships.

Link “Compare memberships” to your pricing/memberships page. Keep it small and calm.

Accessibility and tone checks

Every link and control has a visible focus state that matches the hover underline/outline.

All helper text avoids jargon and directly tells the user what helps us help them.

No auto-capitalization of user input; preserve what they type.

That’s it. These changes keep the page fast and sober but add just enough guidance and interaction to feel intentional, and they explicitly include non-members who have email questions.

Prompt for Replit:
Redesign the Sign In and Create Account pages for Sharp Shot. They should share the same fintech-terminal style, consistent layout, and polish.

1) Shared Page Framework

Full-bleed dark terminal grid background with subtle radial vignette (charcoal → near-black).

Centered container, max-width 480px, vertically centered.

Card: rounded-2xl, soft shadow, slight glass blur, padding ~28–32px.

Typography: sharp, confident, fintech vibe. H2 + muted subhead.

Primary action = Sharp Shot Gold (hover shimmer, pressed darker gold).

Top nav stays consistent: Sharp Shot logo left, “Resources” and “Access Beta” button right. Current page’s nav link appears muted/inactive.

2) Sign In Page

Header copy:

H2: Access Your Terminal

Subhead: Your command center for betting intelligence.

Form fields:

Email (with placeholder).

Password (with visibility toggle).

Focus state: Sharp Shot Gold glow border.

Error state: thin red border + inline helper text.

Aux row:

Left: “Remember me” checkbox.

Right: “Forgot password?” (muted link).

Actions:

Full-width button: Sign In (gold, shimmer hover, spinner on submit).

Below: “Don’t have an account? Create account” → styled as a muted link but changes color on hover (subtle gold glow).

Optional SSO:

Divider with “or” line.

“Continue with Google” and “Continue with Discord” buttons (neutral dark, brand icon left).

Badges:

Row under card: Data-Driven • Transparent • Secure.

Terminal flavor (bottom strip):

Animated typewriter cycling:

> Mapping field odds…

> Identifying +EV…

> Securing data feed…

3) Create Account Page

Header copy:

H2: Create Your Account

Subhead: Start building with real-time betting intelligence.

Form fields:

Full Name

Email

Password (with visibility toggle)

Confirm Password

Each field with same focus/error states as Sign In.

Password requirements:

Show subtle text below password field: “8+ characters, one number, one symbol.”

Error state if requirements not met.

Actions:

Full-width gold button: Create Account (hover shimmer, spinner on submit).

Below: “Already have an account? Sign in” → styled as link, consistent hover effect.

Optional SSO:

Same divider + buttons as Sign In.

Badges & terminal strip:

Same placement + behavior as Sign In for consistency.

4) Accessibility / UX

All forms ARIA-labeled.

Submit on Enter; prevent double-submit.

Mobile responsive, touch targets ≥44px.

Consistent success/error behaviors (inline, no modal popups).

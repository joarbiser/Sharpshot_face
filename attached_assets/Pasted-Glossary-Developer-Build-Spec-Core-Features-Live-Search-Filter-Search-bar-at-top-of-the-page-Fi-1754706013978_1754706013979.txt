Glossary – Developer Build Spec
Core Features
Live Search Filter

Search bar at top of the page.

Filters instantly by term name and definition text.

Case-insensitive.

Shows “No terms found” if nothing matches.

Search input should be keyboard-focusable and styled to match Sharp Shot form elements.

A–Z Jump Navigation

Fixed horizontal row at the top of the glossary with letters A–Z.

Clicking a letter scrolls to that section.

Letters with no terms are disabled or visually dimmed.

On scroll, highlight the active letter in Sharp Shot gold.

Deep Linking & Anchors

Each term gets its own unique id (e.g., id="arbitrage", id="moneyline").

Clicking a glossary term link from anywhere in Sharp Shot (tutorials, FAQs, tooltips) jumps directly to that term and highlights it.

Highlight state: Sharp Shot gold background tint on the term block for 3 seconds, then fade back to normal.

Section Structure

Each letter is a <section> with a sticky heading (e.g., “A”, “B”).

Sticky letter heading stays pinned until the next letter section reaches the top of the viewport.

Responsiveness

On mobile: A–Z nav should be horizontally scrollable.

Sticky letter headings remain, but reduce font size to fit narrow viewports.

Search bar remains fixed at the top of the content when scrolling.

Glossary Content

One <section> per letter.

Each term block:

Term in bold.

Definition in smaller regular text.

Optional “See also” links in small italic or light weight.

Minimum spacing: 24px between term blocks.

Empty State Handling

If search returns no results, show centered text:

“No matches found. Try adjusting your search.”

Animation & Interaction
On load: Fade + slide-up animation for each term block (stagger 80–100ms).

On letter click: Smooth scroll to target section (400ms ease-in-out).

On deep link load: Scroll to the linked term, flash Sharp Shot gold highlight background, fade back to white over 3 seconds.

All hover states: Pointer cursor + slight text color shift to Sharp Shot gold.

Accessibility
All letter links and search bar must be keyboard accessible.

Provide aria-label for each letter link (e.g., “Jump to section A”).

Ensure letter headings have role="heading" for screen readers.

Ensure search bar has a label, even if visually hidden.

Performance Considerations
Use Intersection Observer for:

Highlighting active A–Z letter in the nav.

Triggering animations on first appearance.

Debounce search filtering for large term lists.

Avoid layout shift (CLS) by keeping section heights stable even when filtered.

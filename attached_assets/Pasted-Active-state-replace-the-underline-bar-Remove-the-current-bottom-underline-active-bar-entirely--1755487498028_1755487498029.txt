Active state (replace the underline bar)

Remove the current bottom underline/active bar entirely.

New indicator: a small gold dot (or diamond) placed immediately to the LEFT of the active item text.

Size: 6px x 6px circle (border-radius: 9999px). If using diamond, rotate a 6px square by 45°.

Spacing: 8px between dot and text.

Only render the dot for the active item.

Active item text color is full white (100%). Inactive items use white at 65% opacity.

Dividers between items

Add vertical dividers only between top-level nav groups (e.g., between Preset Terminal and Resources, and between Sign In and the CTA).

1px wide, 16px–20px tall, color rgba(255,255,255,0.06).

Add 12px horizontal padding on each side of each divider.

CTA: Ghost/Outline button with lock icon + shimmer

Label: change to “ACCESS BETA” (or “JOIN FREE” if you prefer shorter). All caps.

Style:

Transparent background.

1px border in #BA9A5B.

Border radius: 9999px (pill).

Padding: 8px 14px (desktop), 8px 12px (mobile).

Text color: #BA9A5B by default.

Subtle outer glow: box-shadow: 0 0 0 rgba(186,154,91,0); on hover elevate to 0 0 14px rgba(186,154,91,0.25).

Icon:

Use a small lock/unlock icon on the left. If you’re in React with Lucide: <LockOpen size={16} strokeWidth={2} />.

8px gap between icon and label.

Hover interaction:

Add a left→right gold shimmer sweep. Implement as a pseudo-element overlay:

Create a ::before overlay with a linear-gradient that has a bright gold strip and transparent sides.

Animate transform/translateX from -100% to +100% over ~1s on hover.

Also slightly increase the glow (see box-shadow above).

Focus/keyboard:

Outline: 2px focus ring in rgba(186,154,91,0.5) inset or outside; offset 2px. No blur on focus.

Active/pressed:

Briefly dim to rgba(186,154,91,0.85) text and tighten the glow to 0 0 6px.

Hover effects for nav items

On hover (non-active): transition text to white at 85% opacity and show a 1px bottom underline that animates in from left to right (200ms). Do NOT show this underline for the active item (active uses the dot).

Dark mode consistency

Keep header translucent and dark as specified.

Inactive items should never be pure white — use the 65% opacity so the active/dot stands out.

Responsive behavior

≥1024px: desktop layout as above.

<1024px:

Collapse center and right nav into a slide-down panel opened by a “Menu” icon (three horizontal lines). Keep the brand at left and the CTA visible at right if space allows; otherwise place the CTA as the first item in the slide-down panel.

Maintain the dot indicator next to the active item in the panel list.

Increase touch targets to 44px height.

ARIA/Accessibility

Mark the active item with aria-current="page".

CTA has aria-label that includes the product context (e.g., “Access Sharp Shot Beta”).

Menu button toggles has aria-expanded and aria-controls bound to the panel id.

Implementation notes (framework-agnostic)

For the dot indicator: either render a <span class="active-dot" /> before the active item text, or use ::before on the active <a> with content:"".

For the shimmer on CTA:

Create ::before with:

position: absolute; inset: 0; transform: translateX(-100%);

background: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 0%, rgba(186,154,91,0.15) 45%, rgba(186,154,91,0.45) 50%, rgba(186,154,91,0.15) 55%, transparent 100%);

opacity: 0; pointer-events: none;

On hover: set opacity: 1 and animate translateX to +100% over 1s ease-out. Reset when hover ends.

Keep all transitions at 180–220ms except the shimmer (1s).

Acceptance criteria

No underline bar under the active nav item. A gold dot/diamond appears to the left of the active item instead.

Inactive items are soft gray (≈65% white). Active item is full white.

Faint vertical dividers separate nav groups.

CTA is a ghost/outline pill with gold border, lock icon on the left, gold text, subtle glow, and a left→right shimmer on hover.

Nav items are ALL CAPS with increased tracking; hover gives a gentle underline animation for non-active items only.

Header is translucent dark with a subtle bottom border and remains readable on scroll (sticky).

Keyboard and screen reader users can identify and operate the menu and CTA (focus ring, aria-current, aria-expanded, etc.).

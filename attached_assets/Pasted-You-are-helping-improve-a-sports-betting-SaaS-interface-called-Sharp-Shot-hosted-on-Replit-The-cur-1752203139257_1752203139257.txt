You are helping improve a sports betting SaaS interface called Sharp Shot, hosted on Replit. The current site includes a homepage with branding, pricing CTAs, and a live betting terminal in "Demo Mode" that showcases +EV betting opportunities.

Please use the following structured breakdown to guide a set of design and interface improvements across UI components, UX behavior, layout logic, and textual copy. Treat these as a complete specification to act on.

üß± HIGH-LEVEL GOALS
Maintain a premium, sharp, data-first aesthetic.

Improve onboarding clarity for new users through tooltips and simplified flows.

Reduce friction to conversion from demo to signup.

Fix any visually broken or unclear elements (disabled buttons, confusing toggles, vague labels).

1. üß≠ NAVIGATION & HEADER
Problems:

The ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù toggle in the navbar is unclear. It is not visually differentiated as a switch or button, and may appear inactive or unclickable.

The ‚ÄúAchievements‚Äù tab is vague and may confuse users unless there is a live gamification or loyalty feature active.

Actions:

Convert ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù from plain text to a toggle-style UI element with animation and/or state change. Add hover tooltip:

Edit
"Demo Mode: Try the full product experience without signing up. No card required."
If ‚ÄúAchievements‚Äù is not functional yet, remove it from the nav entirely to avoid user confusion.

Optional: Animate the appearance of the navbar on scroll for a more dynamic first impression.

2. üß© HERO SECTION
Current Text:

rust
Copy
Edit
It's Not Luck. It's Leverage.
Built for sharp minds. Powered by sharp tools.
Recommendations:

Keep tagline as-is (very effective branding).

Add a subheadline underneath that clearly communicates product value:

Copy
Edit
Instantly identify profitable bets across sportsbooks ‚Äî no guesswork, just edge.
Buttons:

‚ÄúView Pricing‚Äù ‚Üí Keep active.

‚ÄúTry Calculator‚Äù ‚Üí Currently disabled and creates confusion. Replace with:

Either an active CTA that scrolls or jumps to the terminal section.

Or remove it entirely to keep UX clean.

Optional Button Swap:

Copy
Edit
<a href="#terminal" class="button button-secondary">Try the Calculator</a>
3. üìà TERMINAL COMPONENT
This section is one of the most visually engaging parts of the site. It simulates a Bloomberg-style real-time odds interface.

Strengths:

Terminal aesthetics are strong.

Numbers are bold and immediately convey technical credibility.

Good use of green highlights (+EV %, CLV) to denote value.

Issues to Fix:

No Context for Data

Add tooltips or hover icons for key terms:

+EV %: ‚ÄúExpected value ‚Äî shows how profitable the bet is compared to market consensus.‚Äù

CLV: ‚ÄúClosing Line Value ‚Äî shows how much better your odds are than the line at close.‚Äù

BOOKS: ‚ÄúTotal number of books currently scanned for bets.‚Äù

Empty Console Log

connecting... and connected. messages should not be shown to users.

Instead, implement a frontend loading overlay (e.g. spinner or blur effect) while the terminal is loading:

javascript
Copy
Edit
showLoadingMessage("Fetching sharpest lines across 47 sportsbooks...");
Interactivity

If the terminal is ‚Äúread-only‚Äù in Demo Mode, clarify this with a non-intrusive notice above the table:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Demo Mode: You‚Äôre viewing live odds. Sign up to track and save your betting strategy.
4. üì≤ MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
Problem:

Terminal layout is likely too wide for small screens.

Table becomes difficult to scroll, with data being cut off.

Fixes:

Implement horizontal scroll with sticky column headers.

Prioritize most important fields (Teams, +EV, Book, CLV).

Collapse non-critical data fields or move to expandable accordion views.

5. üéØ CTA FLOW AND USER PATH
Suggested Improvement:
After the user scrolls past the terminal, add a Call-To-Action section:

html
Copy
Edit
<section class="cta-section">
  <h2>Ready to bet smarter?</h2>
  <p>Start with the free Demo Mode or unlock full features with a subscription.</p>
  <a href="/pricing" class="button button-primary">View Plans</a>
  <a href="/signup" class="button button-secondary">Try Demo</a>
</section>
Purpose: This gives users another prompt to convert without relying solely on the top navbar.

6. üß† TOOLTIP / COPY CHANGES
Apply tooltips to every critical technical term on the site. Replit AI should generate these using title="" attributes or minimal custom components.

Element	Tooltip Text
+EV	"Positive expected value ‚Äî profit potential over time based on odds inefficiency."
CLV	"Closing Line Value ‚Äî how much better your bet is compared to market close."
Book	"The sportsbook offering this line."
Props, Totals, Spreads	"Bet types: Props = player/team stats, Totals = combined points, Spreads = margin of win."
Demo Mode	"Try the platform with full features and no signup required."

7. üìå DEMO MODE VISIBILITY
Problem: Demo mode is only acknowledged in the top bar.

Suggested Additions:

Add a persistent corner badge or floating bar (bottom-right):

pgsql
Copy
Edit
You‚Äôre in Demo Mode | [Create Account] to save your bets ‚Üí
This reminds users of what they‚Äôre experiencing and nudges toward conversion.

8. üé® MINOR VISUAL POLISH
Add a hover effect to all buttons (subtle lift, gold border glow).

Use transition animations when users scroll down to the terminal (slide-in or fade-in effects).

Consider subtle gold gradient backgrounds or borders in CTAs for premium feel (can be done with linear-gradient styling).

‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY ORDER (Replit Feasibility Focus)
Enable Try Calculator CTA ‚Üí Route to Terminal

Add tooltips to Terminal columns

Remove Console logs from user view

Clarify Demo Mode with floating label/bar

Simplify mobile layout of Terminal

Hide or clarify Achievements tab

Add CTA section below Terminal

Implement hover states on buttons

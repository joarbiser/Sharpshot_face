Understanding the Difference Between Pro and Unlimited
Pro — $59.99/month
Pro is the ideal starting point for bettors who want to apply sharp, data-driven strategies without committing to every advanced feature. It’s also well-suited for those managing a smaller bankroll, where the focus is on precision and discipline rather than sheer volume.

What you get in Pro:

+EV Calculator: Core tool for identifying bets where the odds are in your favor.

Real-Time Line Tracker: Watch line movement and react before the market shifts.

CLV Comparison (24h): Measure how your bets stack up against the closing line over 24 hours.

Advanced Filters: Zero in on sports, markets, and odds ranges that fit your style.

Export to CSV: Store, review, and analyze your historical data offline.

Dark Mode: Comfortable viewing during extended sessions.

Public Preset Browsing: See and learn from other users’ saved strategies.

Save & Share 2 Presets: Build and share up to two of your own strategies.

Best for:

Bettors building consistency and discipline.

Players starting with a smaller bankroll who want to maximize each opportunity.

Users who want the essential tools to bet smarter without extra complexity.

Unlimited — $99.99/month

The Key Difference
Pro gives you the core analytical tools to place smarter bets and develop your strategies — perfect for those focused on precision, learning, and steady bankroll growth.

Unlimited gives you every calculator and collaboration feature, so you can capture more types of profitable plays, manage more strategies, and work without preset or sharing limits.

Both plans work toward the same goal: helping you win more often with better information. The choice is whether you want to start lean or scale immediately.

Sharp Shot UI/UX Audit and Improvement Plan  
--------------------------------------------

Context:  
You are working on a sports betting SaaS interface called Sharp Shot, hosted on Replit. The current site includes a homepage with branding, pricing CTAs, and a live betting terminal in "Demo Mode" that showcases +EV betting opportunities.

This document provides a structured breakdown of design and interface improvements across UI components, UX behavior, layout logic, accessibility, and copywriting. Use this as a working spec for ongoing updates.

----------------------------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL GOALS
----------------------------------------------------
- Maintain a premium, sharp, data-first aesthetic.
- Improve onboarding clarity for new users through tooltips and simplified flows.
- Reduce friction to conversion from demo to signup.
- Resolve layout and readability issues on both desktop and mobile.
- Improve contrast and accessibility across all terminal components.
- Retain all existing sections while improving clarity and functionality.

----------------------------------------------------
1. NAVIGATION & HEADER
----------------------------------------------------
Issues:
- The “Demo” label in the navbar appears static and may not clearly indicate it's active or interactive.
- The “Achievements” tab may not be self-explanatory and could lead to confusion if its function isn’t obvious.

Recommendations:
- Convert “Demo” into an interactive toggle-style element or add a subtle animation/state indicator.
- Add hover tooltip to Demo:
  "Demo Mode: Try the full product experience without signing up. No card required."
- Ensure “Achievements” links to an explanatory page or tooltip. Clarify what users should expect to find there (for example: badges earned, referral bonuses, leaderboard position, etc.).
- Optionally animate the navbar on scroll for smoother transitions.

----------------------------------------------------
2. HERO SECTION
----------------------------------------------------
Current Copy:
"It's Not Luck. It's Leverage."  
"Built for sharp minds. Powered by sharp tools."

Keep this branding intact. It’s working well.

Add subheadline to clarify the product’s benefit:
"Instantly identify profitable bets across sportsbooks — no guesswork, just edge."

Buttons:
- "View Pricing" works as-is.
- "Try Calculator" is currently disabled. This could create friction or confusion.

Instead of removing it:
- Re-enable the button with a scroll-to-anchor link to the terminal or set it to launch the Demo directly.

Example:
<a href="#terminal" class="button button-secondary">Try the Calculator</a>

----------------------------------------------------
3. TERMINAL COMPONENT
----------------------------------------------------
Strengths:
- Visual design is excellent. The terminal looks sophisticated and data-driven.
- High contrast values (+EV, CLV) are visually distinct and impactful.

Recommendations:
1. Add tooltips for key data terms:
  - +EV: "Expected value — shows how profitable the bet is compared to market consensus."
  - CLV: "Closing Line Value — how much better your odds are than the line at close."
  - BOOKS: "Number of sportsbooks scanned."

2. Console output:
- Avoid displaying internal status logs like `connecting...` or `connected.` to end users.
- Replace with a polished message such as:
  "Fetching sharpest lines across 47 sportsbooks..."
- Add a spinner or blur layer while loading to reinforce this state.

3. Demo Mode Clarification:
- Above or below the terminal, display a static message such as:
  "Demo Mode: You’re viewing live odds. Sign up to track and save your betting strategy."

4. Contrast Fix:
- Some terminal elements currently use white or light text on a white/light background.
- Fix using the following:
  a) Use background: #343434 or #3B3B3D for terminal rows and headers
  b) Use color: white or #FAFAFA for all data text
  c) Use #BA9A5B (Sharp Shot gold) only for highlights like EV values, not full table text

----------------------------------------------------
4. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
----------------------------------------------------
Problem:
- The terminal layout exceeds screen width on mobile.
- Data columns may be cut off or difficult to read.

Recommendations:
- Wrap the terminal table in a scrollable container:
  `overflow-x: auto; white-space: nowrap;`
- Consider making low-priority columns collapsible or hidden behind a toggle in smaller viewports.
- Pin or prioritize key columns (Teams, +EV %, Book, CLV).
- Use sticky column headers or swipeable cards if full horizontal scrolling is too difficult.

----------------------------------------------------
5. CTA FLOW AND USER PATH
----------------------------------------------------
After the terminal, add a clear call-to-action block:

<section class="cta-section">
  <h2>Ready to bet smarter?</h2>
  <p>Start with the free Demo Mode or unlock full features with a subscription.</p>
  <a href="/pricing" class="button button-primary">View Plans</a>
  <a href="/signup" class="button button-secondary">Try Demo</a>
</section>

This allows users to take action right after seeing the terminal without relying only on the header.

----------------------------------------------------
6. TOOLTIP / COPY IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------------------------------
Add tooltips to all technical or betting-specific terms. These can be implemented using `title=""` attributes or with custom tooltips.

Suggested copy:

+EV — "Positive expected value — profit potential over time based on odds inefficiency."  
CLV — "Closing Line Value — how much better your bet is compared to the final market line."  
Book — "The sportsbook offering this line."  
Props — "Player or team stat bets (e.g., yards, receptions, strikeouts)."  
Totals — "Combined point totals for a game."  
Spreads — "Margin-based bets on victory or loss."  
Demo Mode — "Try the platform with full features and no signup required."

----------------------------------------------------
7. DEMO MODE VISIBILITY
----------------------------------------------------
Currently, Demo Mode is only acknowledged in the navbar or top bar.

Recommendation:
- Add a fixed badge or floating label to the bottom right corner of the screen:
  "You’re in Demo Mode | Create Account to save your bets →"
- Design it with a dark background, gold border, and dismiss option.
- Keep it visible during Demo sessions to maintain clarity and gently encourage signup.

----------------------------------------------------
8. VISUAL POLISH
----------------------------------------------------
- Add hover states to all primary and secondary buttons (scale, outline glow, or slight color shift).
- Use smooth transitions for:
  a) Terminal scroll-in animation
  b) CTA fade-in after the terminal section
- For extra branding polish, apply a subtle gold gradient to CTA buttons or cards using:
  `background: linear-gradient(90deg, #BA9A5B, #D4B072);`

----------------------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY ORDER
----------------------------------------------------
1. Enable the “Try Calculator” button and link to terminal view  
2. Add tooltips to Terminal table headers and key metrics  
3. Replace console logs with a proper loading message and spinner  
4. Adjust terminal text/background contrast for full readability  
5. Add Demo Mode floating badge for visibility  
6. Ensure mobile layout scrolls properly and shows prioritized columns  
7. Add CTA section below the terminal view  
8. Update navbar interactions (Demo toggle clarity, Achievements label explanation)  
9. Implement visual polish (hover effects, animation, gradients)

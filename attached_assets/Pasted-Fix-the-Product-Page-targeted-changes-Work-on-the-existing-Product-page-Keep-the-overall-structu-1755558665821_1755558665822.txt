Fix the Product Page (targeted changes)

Work on the existing Product page. Keep the overall structure. Make the following adjustments so the layout reads clean and consistent.

1) Global spacing & container

Use a single max-width container for all body sections so cards and “How It Works” align on the same vertical grid.

Reduce the vertical gap between the Feature Cards row and “How It Works” to a medium spacing (it’s too tall right now).

Ensure consistent section padding top/bottom across Feature Cards, How It Works, and subsequent sections.

2) Feature Cards (3-up)

Make all three cards equal height at desktop so the bottoms align.

Replace the tiny “Learn more” text link with a full-card expandable area:

Clicking the card (or a chevron in the top-right) toggles an inline description.

Only one card may be expanded at a time; expanding one collapses the others.

When collapsed: show icon, title, and the single-sentence blurb, no “Learn more” text.

When expanded: show a short paragraph (3–4 lines max). Add a “Show less” control in the card footer.

Card hover: very light lift and slight title brighten. No underline anywhere.

Keep borders subtle and corners soft—avoid heavy, boxy visuals.

Copy to use

+EV Bets (expanded): “Our algorithms analyze market inefficiencies by calculating fair odds after removing sportsbook margins, highlighting bets with genuine positive expected value.”

Arbitrage (expanded): “When two books disagree on price, you can cover both sides and lock in profit regardless of the outcome.”

Middles (expanded): “When the market leaves a gap between numbers/lines, both sides can win, creating outsized upside with controlled risk.”

3) “How It Works” alignment & interaction

Center the section heading and subheading, but align the four step items to the same grid width as the Feature Cards above.

Each step uses: small icon, short title, one-line description. Keep line lengths consistent so rows feel balanced.

The “View an example” link should not underline on hover. Use a subtle brightness pulse instead.

Example row: show a single mock opportunity with clearly labeled fields: Market, Sportsbook, Line/Odds, Fair Odds, EV%, Suggested Stake. Keep it to one row with tooltips—not a full table.

4) Hover conventions (site-wide on this page)

Replace any underline/overline behaviors on links with either:

slight brightness pulse, or

tiny weight/letter-spacing change.

Active nav uses a filled dot. Hover state uses a “light” dot that fills on active.

5) Visual rhythm

Unify icon sizing across cards and steps (same visual size and baseline).

Normalize heading sizes between Feature Cards titles and How It Works step titles.

Ensure consistent shadow/outline treatment on cards; don’t mix styles.

6) Support CTA (above footer)

Short block with heading and one sentence, plus button that opens the conversational form modal you already built for Support.

Include explicit note that non-members can ask questions.

Copy

Heading: “Questions? Ask us like you’d talk to a person.”

Body: “Whether you’ve signed up or not, send questions and we’ll help.”

Button: “Contact Support”

7) Footer touch-ups

Keep brand left and quiet tagline right.

Add a small row of social icons (no heavy treatments). Use subtle separators between link groups.

Maintain the “system/tech” feel via alignment, spacing, and micro-interactions—not flashy graphics.

8) Accessibility & motion

Respect reduced-motion; disable shimmer/scanline if prefers-reduced-motion is on.

Ensure all interactive elements (cards, “View an example”) are keyboard accessible with clear focus states.

9) Acceptance checklist

Cards: equal height, only one expanded at a time, no “Learn more” text links, hover lift/pulse only.

“How It Works”: heading centered, steps aligned to the same grid as cards, link uses pulse (no underline), single example row.

No underlines/overlines anywhere on hover for this page.

Consistent icon sizing, headings, shadows, and section spacing.

Support CTA present and clearly invites non-members.

Footer includes socials and subtle dividers; remains minimal.

Apply these changes to the current implementation without altering the overall copy or introducing new colors or fonts. Keep everything minimal, modern, and consistent with the rest of the site.

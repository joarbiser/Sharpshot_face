Trading Terminal Frontend – Match Daily Grind’s Depth

We already have the table structure working. Now expand it so the user sees the same richness of data that competitors like Daily Grind show. Backend is already sending this data — we just need to display it.

1. Add Missing Columns

Alongside what we already have (Event, Market, Fair Odds, EV%, My Price, Field Prices, Consensus, Status, Actions), add these:

Sportsbook Projection / Model Line

Show the backend’s “fair line” or model projection (e.g., 6.5 runs, -120 moneyline).

Tooltip: “Our model’s true projection after vig removal.”

% Odds to Hit

Show the implied probability from the fair odds (backend provides).

Format as a percentage (ex: 58.93% → 58.9%).

Tooltip: “Probability of this bet winning after removing vig.”

Min / Max Odds (field range)

Instead of only showing consensus, show the range: lowest odds across the market, highest odds across the market.

Example: “Range: -149 to -165.”

Tooltip: “Lowest and highest prices found across all books.”

2. EV% Styling (Traffic Light)

≤ –2% EV = solid red.

–2% → 0% = fade red → orange.

0% = yellow.

0 → +3% = fade yellow → green.

≥ +3% = solid green.

3. Field Prices Expansion

Inline: show 5–6 main books.

If more, show “+N more” → on click/hover expand full list.

Display each book with odds pill.

If line mismatch, dim it and show actual line in tooltip.

4. Consensus Improvements

Show consensus odds (median of market).

Also show number of contributing books (ex: “22 books”).

Display next to each other like: +407 (22 books).

5. Filters / Controls

Add Min/Max Odds filter.

Add Minimum Data Points filter (like Daily Grind). User sets how many books must agree before showing a row.

Keep existing filters: League, Market, Status, EV%, My Books, Search.

Reset button clears all.

6. Row Expansion

Expand row to show:

Full odds ladder (every book, grouped by identical lines).

Kelly stake suggestions (if backend provides).

History sparkline of EV% (if backend provides).

Model probability breakdown.

7. Status Column

Replace “0s ago” with clean relative time (ex: “34s ago,” “2m ago”).

Add Live/Prematch chips.

8. Acceptance Checklist

Columns: Event, Market, Projection, Fair Odds, % Odds to Hit, EV%, My Price, Field Prices, Consensus, Range (min/max), Status, Actions.

EV% has traffic light gradient.

My Price = user-selected books only.

Field Prices = all others, expandable.

Consensus shows both median and count.

Filters include min/max odds and minimum data points.

Row expansion shows ladder + Kelly + history.

Status shows relative time and live/prematch.

No invalid dates.

Sorting works across all sortable columns.

👉 In plain words: Give the user the same depth of info as Daily Grind — projections, hit %, min/max ranges, and better filters — while keeping Sharp Shot’s cleaner, modern look. The backend is already giving us the data; just render it.

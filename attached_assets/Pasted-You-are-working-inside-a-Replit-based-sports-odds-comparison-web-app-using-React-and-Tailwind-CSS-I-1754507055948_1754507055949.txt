You are working inside a Replit-based sports odds comparison web app using React and Tailwind CSS. Implement the following improvements to match the visual quality and layout seen on OddsJam (reference images provided).

üéØ Your Task:
Apply these features non-destructively within the existing Sharp Shot codebase ‚Äî don't overwrite existing components, but extend and insert where appropriate.

‚úÖ 1. Odds Table Layout (Inspired by OddsJam)
Display all sportsbook odds (including "AVG") in one aligned row next to the EV% and main line.

Use Tailwind grid or flex to maintain equal spacing and alignment across all cells.

Do not stack odds or separate "AVG" on a new row. Just give it distinct styling:

jsx
Copy
Edit
className="bg-green-900 text-green-200 font-bold rounded-md px-2 py-1"
‚úÖ 2. Add Sportsbook Logos Above Odds
For each odds cell, show a sportsbook logo above the number:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center space-y-1">
  <img
    src={`/booklogos/${bookName.toLowerCase()}.png`}
    alt={bookName}
    className="h-5 object-contain"
    onError={(e) => (e.currentTarget.style.display = 'none')}
  />
  <span>{odds}</span>
</div>
Logos are stored in: /public/booklogos/

Ensure logos don't flash or glitch if missing.

‚úÖ 3. Keep Everything Responsive
On smaller screens, ensure odds row wraps without breaking alignment.

Use Tailwind grid or responsive flex like:

jsx
Copy
Edit
className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-6 gap-2"
‚úÖ 4. Don't Break Existing Logic or Styles
Reuse any existing component hierarchy (OddsRow, BookOddsCell, etc.).

Don‚Äôt touch auth, EV logic, or API integrations ‚Äî just improve the UI/UX and alignment.

‚úÖ 5. Make it Look Clean and Sharp
Match OddsJam-like polish by using:

Soft shadows (shadow-md)

Borders on odds boxes (border border-gray-700)

Rounded elements (rounded-lg)

Good spacing (p-2, gap-4, mt-4, etc.)

üß™ Output Should:
Show all odds side-by-side with logos

Keep ‚ÄúAVG‚Äù inline

Render logos cleanly

Be readable, mobile-friendly, and consistent

Match the aesthetic of OddsJam‚Äôs dark sleek interface

Implement all changes in place ‚Äî add logic and layout in appropriate components based on existing code structure.

next Ill provide a screenshot of my site and I need it to look like the images I provided. layout wise not styling. please give replit a detailed prompt with instructions

Here‚Äôs a full and detailed Replit prompt based on the comparison between your site (Sharp Shot) and the OddsJam layout you've shown.

üõ† Prompt for Replit ‚Äî Restructure Page to Match OddsJam-Style Layout
You are working within an existing sports betting data web app called Sharp Shot, built in React + Tailwind CSS, hosted on Replit. Your goal is to refactor the layout of the main live terminal page to match the OddsJam-style layout, without affecting current app logic, APIs, or data structure.

üìê Layout Goals:
1. Restructure Layout to Match OddsJam Terminal
Move the metrics block (BOOKS SCANNED, +EV SIGNALS, AVG CLV, WIN RATE) into a horizontal flex container like:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="flex flex-wrap justify-around w-full gap-6 mb-4">
  <!-- Each metric block here -->
</div>
Center-align and evenly space each block. Keep text sizes responsive (text-lg sm:text-xl).

2. Filter Section Alignment
Convert the filter bar (PRIMARY BOOK, MARKET FILTER, EV THRESHOLD, STATUS) into a single row with 4 filter sections.

Use a Tailwind grid:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4 w-full mb-6">
  <!-- 4 filter items go here -->
</div>
3. Fix Odds Table Header and Grid
Ensure the table header row stays fixed and lines up with the data rows beneath.

Use table-fixed or a grid grid-cols-N layout with defined widths like:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="grid grid-cols-[200px,100px,120px,100px,100px,100px,auto] text-left font-semibold text-sm border-b border-gray-700">
  <!-- Headers like Event, League, EV%, Odds, etc -->
</div>
Do not allow AVG odds or comparison odds to break onto new lines ‚Äî all odds should be in one horizontal row per event.

üéØ Visual/Component Rules:
Odds & Field Comparison Row:
Align EV%, Odds, and Field Comparison in a single flex row.

Insert a div to hold logos and odds values:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center space-y-1">
  <img src={`/booklogos/${book}.png`} alt={book} class="h-5" />
  <span class="text-sm font-semibold">{odds}</span>
</div>
Keep Elements Aligned Across Rows:
Ensure all rows follow the same grid-cols structure.

Example (per row):

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div class="grid grid-cols-[200px,100px,120px,100px,100px,100px,auto] items-center gap-2 py-2">
  <!-- Event, League, Market, Book, EV%, Odds, Field Comparison -->
</div>
üí° Additional Notes:
Don't break existing logic. Just restructure the JSX layout and use Tailwind utilities.

Ensure layout scales properly on desktop and tablet. Mobile is secondary for now.

Add spacing between sections (mt-4, gap-6, etc.) for readability.

Style tweaks (colors/fonts) can remain as-is for now ‚Äî focus on matching structure and alignment first.

üß™ Result Should:
Have a dashboard-like top section (like OddsJam)

Display odds and sportsbook comparisons in a clean horizontal layout

Keep data readable, structured, and spaced out

Avoid broken image glitches (logos should load cleanly)

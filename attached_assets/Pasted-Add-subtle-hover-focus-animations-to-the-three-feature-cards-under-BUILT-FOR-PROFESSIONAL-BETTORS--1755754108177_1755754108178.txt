Add subtle hover/focus animations to the three feature cards under “BUILT FOR PROFESSIONAL BETTORS.” Keep the copy and layout exactly as-is. Use our existing brand tokens (gold, charcoal, neutrals) — don’t invent new colors.

Overall feel

Trading-terminal, clean, confident.

Animations are quick and purposeful, not flashy.

No infinite loops. Trigger on hover and keyboard focus, then stop.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if it’s on, skip movement and just do a gentle color/outline change.

Shared card behavior

On hover/focus the card lifts a couple pixels, the outline warms toward brand gold, and a soft inner glow appears.

No layout shift. Card size stays fixed.

Card-specific micro-animations (play once per hover/focus)

Spot Edges in Real Time

Show “40+ Books” as a small badge.

On hover: quickly count 40 → 42 → 44 → back to “40+”.

At the same time, run a single radar sweep behind the icon (one pass with a faint trailing tail), then settle.

Systematize Your Strategy

Show a tiny two-handle slider.

On hover: nudge both handles a few pixels to new positions (like you’re tightening a filter).

Flash a small checkmark above the right end of the track for a quarter second, then fade out.

Collaborate and Share

Show a mini network: four small nodes in a diamond with faint lines.

On hover: draw the connections in sequence (top↔left, left↔bottom, bottom↔right, right↔top).

When the last line completes, brighten all lines toward brand gold briefly, then return to rest.

Accessibility & controls

Each card must be focusable with a visible focus ring.

Keyboard focus should trigger the same animation as hover.

Provide clear aria-labels for the cards.

Light/Dark

Keep everything readable in both modes. The backdrop grid and glows should stay subtle.

Success check

Each card plays its mini-animation once per hover/focus and resets cleanly.

Reduced-motion disables movement but keeps the color/outline feedback.

No jank, no layout jumps, and performance stays smooth.

Implement the mini-animations as lightweight inline SVG (or simple divs) so they’re fast. Keep durations around 0.8–1.1s total.

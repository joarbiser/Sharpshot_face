Build Tabs for “Glossary”, “Patch Notes”, and “Support”
Goal
Create a three-tab interface under Resources with tabs: Glossary, Patch Notes, Support. Clean, fast, accessible, and consistent with Sharp Shot styling. Default to Glossary.

Placement & Routing
Lives under the Resources page/route.

Each tab must have its own URL hash so links are shareable:

.../resources#glossary

.../resources#patch-notes

.../resources#support

On load, read the hash and activate the matching tab. If no hash, open Glossary.

Updating tabs should also update the hash (no full page reload).

Tab Bar (UI/UX)
Horizontal tab bar at the top of the Resources content area.

Active tab: Sharp Shot gold underline (2px) and active text state.

Hover: subtle color shift to Sharp Shot gold.

Use equal spacing; tabs remain visible on mobile (wrap to two lines if necessary).

Sticky sub-nav: when the user scrolls past the tab bar, keep it stuck to the top of the content area.

Accessibility
Implement as proper tabs:

role="tablist" on the container

role="tab" on buttons/labels

role="tabpanel" on content containers

Use aria-selected, aria-controls, and matching ids

Keyboard: Left/Right arrow to move focus between tabs, Enter/Space to activate.

Maintain focus styles; do not remove outlines.

State & Performance
No page reloads. Show/hide tabpanels.

Preserve scroll position within the Resources page when switching tabs.

Remember last-opened tab in sessionStorage; use hash first, then session fallback.

Styling
Background: white content area.

Tab text: charcoal; active text and underline use Sharp Shot gold.

No heavy shadows; clean, finance-grade look.

Mobile: tabs become scrollable horizontally if space is tight; show slight fade at edges to indicate scroll.

Content Requirements
1) Glossary
Purpose: Quick reference for betting terms used in Sharp Shot.

Layout: two-column on desktop, one column on mobile.

Search input at top (client-side filter):

Filters by term name and definition text.

Instant results; show “No terms found” empty state.

A–Z jump nav (optional): compact list of letters; clicking scrolls within the panel to the first term for that letter.

Each term block:

Term (bold), short definition (1–2 sentences), optional “Learn more” link (anchors to Tutorials if available).

Allow deep linking to a specific term via #glossary-term-id after the main hash.

2) Patch Notes
Purpose: Changelog for releases and improvements.

Reverse chronological list (most recent first).

Each release item:

Version/tag (e.g., “2025.08.15”), date, short summary line.

Expandable details: “New”, “Improved”, “Fixed”, “Deprecated” groupings.

Optional filters at top: toggle chips for New/Improved/Fixed.

Collapsed by default beyond the most recent 2 releases; “Show older notes” expands the archive.

Each release has its own anchor (e.g., #patch-2025-08-15) to support direct linking.

Empty state if no notes (should not occur, but handle it cleanly).

3) Support
Purpose: Self-serve answers + clear contact paths.

Top section: short intro line and three fast-action cards:

Contact Support → mailto to support@sharpshotcalc.com

Report a Bug → opens a simple form modal (name/email/description/steps to reproduce; success toast)

Request a Feature → simple form modal (name/email/use case/impact; success toast)

Below cards: Common Issues (accordion list of ~8–12 items).

Each item: short question title + expandable answer.

Answers can link to relevant Tutorials or Glossary anchors.

Service note: display current status banner (optional, non-blocking).

Response times: brief SLA note (“We typically reply within 24–48 hours on business days.”)

Linking & Nav Integration
In the main site nav under Resources, link directly to:

Tutorials (existing)

FAQ (existing)

Glossary (/resources#glossary)

Patch Notes (/resources#patch-notes)

Support (/resources#support)

Keep Resources top-level label; the tabs live inside the Resources page.

Animations
On tab change: fade old panel out and new panel in (200–250ms), no slide/bounce.

Maintain our global Fade + Slide-Up on first reveal of each panel’s content (stagger 80–120ms).

QA Checklist
Hash loads correct tab on first visit and on refresh.

Keyboard navigation works across tabs and accordions.

Mobile: tab bar scrollable or wraps; no layout shift.

Search in Glossary filters instantly and is case-insensitive.

Patch Notes anchors scroll to the correct release.

Support forms validate and show success/clear errors.

Colors match brand; active tab underline uses Sharp Shot gold.

No console errors; no layout shift (CLS) on tab switch.

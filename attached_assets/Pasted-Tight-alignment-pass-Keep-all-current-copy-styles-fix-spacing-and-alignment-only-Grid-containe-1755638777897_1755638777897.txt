Tight alignment pass. Keep all current copy/styles; fix spacing and alignment only.

Grid & container

Give the compare card the same max width as pricing.

Inside, use a 2-column grid (equal widths) with a centered vertical divider. Gutter 32–36.

All paddings/margins snap to a 4px baseline.

Header row (per column)

Micro pill, title, price line, and one-line summary must baseline-align across columns.

Price line: currency symbol and numerals share one baseline; “/month” sits tight on the same baseline at lower emphasis.

Divider

Hairline gold divider starts below the header row and ends above the footer band.

Exactly centered between columns.

Feature lists

Each row = icon + text block. Use flex so the icon and the first line of the label share a baseline.

Icon size consistent; no vertical drift. Align to text-top, not center.

Use a hanging indent: if the explainer wraps, its second line aligns under the label text, not under the icon.

Row gap 10–12. Insert a faint horizontal hairline every 4 rows and make those hairlines line up in both columns.

Column rhythm

Title → 8px → price line → 12px → summary → 16px → list start.

Ensure list tops align across columns.

“Best for” sub-cards

Same radius/border as cards, compact padding.

Set both sub-cards to equal height (use the taller content as the min-height) so their bottoms align.

Top margin before each sub-card: 16–20.

Footer band

Fix copy spacing (“discipline. Unlimited…”).

Center it; left/right edges align to the inner column edges.

Global alignment checks

Left text edges of both columns align vertically.

All bullets/checks sit on the same x-position.

No element (pill, title, price, summary) overhangs the column edges.

On mobile (stacked), remove the divider; preserve the same left edge and hanging-indent rules.

Acceptance

Baselines match across columns (pill, title, price, summary, list start).

Icons align with label first lines; wrapped lines hang correctly.

Divider centered and starts/ends at the correct y-positions.

Sub-cards share the same bottom line.

Footer band centered and aligned to the grid.

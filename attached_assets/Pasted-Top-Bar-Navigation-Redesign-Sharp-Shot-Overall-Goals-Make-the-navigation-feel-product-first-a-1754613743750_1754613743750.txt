Top Bar (Navigation) Redesign – Sharp Shot

Overall Goals:

Make the navigation feel product-first and premium, aligned with the Sharp Shot brand.

Improve hierarchy so the most important features (Trading Terminal, Preset Terminal) are still easily accessible but do not crowd the top bar.

Strengthen brand presence and make the bar feel like part of a professional, finance-grade betting platform instead of a generic SaaS template.

Maintain a clean, minimal, and sharp visual style.

1. Structure & Layout
Left-aligned section:

Sharp Shot logo on the far left.

Directly to the right of the logo: Main navigation links.

Right-aligned section:

Pricing link

Resources link

Sign In button (secondary style)

Get Started Free button (primary CTA, Sharp Shot gold)

2. Navigation Grouping
Instead of having “Trading Terminal” and “Preset Terminal” as separate top-level items, use a “Product” dropdown menu:

Hover or click on “Product” reveals a dropdown with:

Trading Terminal

Preset Terminal

(Room for future tools without crowding the nav)

Dropdown should match the premium style — white background, soft shadow, rounded corners, link hover in Sharp Shot gold.

3. Brand Presence
Increase top bar height slightly for a more premium, confident feel.

Add a thin bottom border in Sharp Shot gold for a subtle accent and to visually separate it from the page content.

Logo size should be reduced slightly so it vertically aligns with nav text.

Keep logo padding consistent on left and right so it doesn’t feel “floating.”

4. Navigation Hierarchy & Interactions
Links should have:

Default state: Clean black or charcoal text

Hover state: Underline in Sharp Shot gold or text color changes to Sharp Shot gold

Active page state: Thin Sharp Shot gold underline (persistent) so the user knows which page they’re on.

Make sure all spacing between links is consistent and visually balanced.

5. Call-to-Action Styling
“Get Started Free” button:

Background: Sharp Shot gold

Text: Black or charcoal for contrast

Slightly larger than other buttons, but with tight padding for a sharp look (not overly pill-shaped)

Hover state: Darker gold shade with subtle scale-up animation for interactivity

“Sign In” button:

Background: White with charcoal or black border

Hover state: Sharp Shot gold border and text

6. Stickiness & Scroll Behavior
Make the top bar sticky on scroll — it should remain visible at the top of the screen at all times.

When sticky, add a slight drop shadow under the bar so it feels anchored above the page content.

7. Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness
Collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller viewports.

Keep logo and “Get Started Free” visible at all times on mobile — hamburger menu should contain all other links.

Dropdown menus should still function smoothly on tap.

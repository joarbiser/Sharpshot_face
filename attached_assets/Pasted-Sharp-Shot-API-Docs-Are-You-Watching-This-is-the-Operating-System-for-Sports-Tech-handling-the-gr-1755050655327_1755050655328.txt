Sharp Shot API Docs
Are You Watching This?! is the Operating System for Sports Tech, handling the grunt work of processing and translating data from providers around the globe and freeing you to focus on driving fan engagement through our patented Excitement Ratings, live Sports Gambling data from our MetaBet brand, Video Highlights, TV Listings, OTT Deep-Links, and more.

To get started with the API, you can browse through the various endpoints, learn about our response formats and response codes, or brainstorm via Quick Start.

Questions? Requests? Contact Mark Phillip at mark@areyouwatchingthis.com or (512) 850-5815.

Odds (GameOdds)

Returns Spread, Over/Under, and Money Line odds data for games. The structure is similar to the Games endpoint, with an added odds field with a CONSENSUS line listed first, and then individual odds providers listed alphabetically. Spread values are always relative to the home team, so in a game where the spread is -3.5, the home team is favored.

As with all endpoints, the 1 index is for the away team and the 2 index is for the home team. moneyLine1/moneyLine2 represent the Money Line prices for the away and home team. The spread value is relative to the home team and spreadLine1/spreadLine2 represent the Spread prices for the away and home team. overUnder is the Over/Under line and overUnderLineOver/overUnderLineUnder represent the prices for the Over and Under wagers.

All prices are listed in decimal format, and the URLs listed in the response deep-link directly to books using the MetaBet Redirect service.

Parameters:

teamID
gameID
q
You can pass in a free-text query like 'yankees' or 'nhl/rangers'.

Response Formats
Each endpoint is available in JSON and XML. A small handful of endpoints are also available as pipe-delimited flat files.

To select the format of the response, simply change the file extension in the request.

Today's Games in XML
https://sharpshot.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/games.xml
Today's Games in JSON
https://sharpshot.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/games.json
Today's Games in Flat File
https://sharpshot.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/games.flat
Response Codes and Error Handling
Whenever possible, we attempt to return descriptive HTTP status codes to signal success or failure of a request. XML and JSON responses repeat the code in the response, and include a description of the data returned or the error that occurred.

In XML responses, these are described in the root <ruwtapi> element, and in JSON they are located in the "meta" property. The response code mimics the standard HTTP status codes, returning 200 for a successful query, 400 for a query missing required parameters, and 404 for a query requesting data that doesn't exist.

Static API Servers
Our traditional API servers are complemented by Static API servers. The lightning-fast cache servers return HTTP-compressed data, reducing bandwidth by as much as 90% for some endpoints. They're a great choice for data that doesn't change often, like the Station and Provider endpoints, any requests performed on mobile clients, and any high-frequency requests.

Traditional: https://sharpshot.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/games.json
Static: https://sharpshot.static.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/games.json

Notes
Most elements in the response are self-explanatory, but here is information on a few elements and concepts that are a bit more complex.

assetURLs

This element lists multiple, assets related to each piece of content, which are all optional. A profile picture for the account will be a profileImage value, and a higher-resolution "cover" photo for the account will be profileBackgroundImage.

It can also have three lists of assets: gifs, photos, and videos. When present, each element in each list will have at least a url to the location of the media, along with an optional thumbnailURL.

date, time

Games almost always include a date and time element. In most cases the date element can be ignored, as the exact start date and start time will be represented by the time element. However, if the start time of a game is TBA, the time element will be empty and the date element should be used to determine the date of the game.

headline, headlineDate

Using our Natural Language engine, we craft pre-game, in-game, and post-game prose that can be used as headlines, for every game.

Headlines are under 150 characters, and they articulate the major storyline of a game, if any. Headlines are automatically generated and available as soon as a game is scheduled, and much like pre-game Excitement Ratings, evolve as the start time approaches. During the game, we continually update the headline as the game progresses. In most cases, the headline becomes more "rich" the longer the game is in progress, as the key storylines and players emerge. Once the game goes final, a recap headline is automatically written.

The headlineDate element has been deprecated, and should no longer be relied on.

imageID
for airings and stations

When present, the imageID for a station can be used to retrieve the station's logo.

MLB Network, Small (imageID: 481)
https://static.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/stations/481_sm.gif
MLB Network, Regular (imageID: 481)
https://static.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/stations/481_c.gif
MLB Network, Medium (imageID: 481)
https://static.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/stations/481_m.gif
MLB Network, Large (imageID: 481)
https://static.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/stations/481_l.gif
Formatting Gambling Lines

All of the prices in odds-related endpoints are expressed in a decimal format to maximize accuracy and portability.

A popular format to display to users is "American" style, using round numbers like -110 (1.90909) and +250 (3.5). We've included psuedocode below that shows how to convert from Decimal to American. Note that a price of 1 represents a disabled wager.

if ((price == null) || (price == 1)) {
	return null;
} else if (price < 2) {
	return Math.round(-1 * (1 / (price - 1)) * 100);
} else {
	return Math.round((price - 1) * 100);
}
    
leagueCode

The important leagueCode parameter represents an individual league within a sport. There's usually a one-to-one mapping between sports and leagues (NBA -> BKP, NFL -> FBP), but Soccer, Golf, and Auto Racing are examples of sports that contain multiple individual leagues.

You can query most endpoints with either a sport or a leagueCode parameter, but some data-heavy endpoints only accept the more granular leagueCode, so it's recommended that you rely on them whenever possible. The full list of sports and leagues are available in the Sports endpoint.

MetaBet Redirect URLs

The URLs listed in the Odds endpoint all rely on the MetaBet redirect service. It not only understands RUWT?! Game IDs, but also team names and IDs from other providers like Sportradar, STATS, TMS, and others.

Team Name
https://go.metabet.io/bet/browns
Sport + Team Name
https://go.metabet.io/bet/nhl/rangers
RUWT?! Game ID
https://go.metabet.io/bet/417016

https://go.metabet.io/bet/417016/fanduel
Sportradar Game ID

TMS Program ID
https://go.metabet.io/bet/EP000031282148
Registration Page
https://go.metabet.io/bet/fanduel
points, pointsLevel

The points element is the numerical rating of excitement for a game. Zero is the lowest value possible and there's no upper bound. The pointsLevel element is a verbal description of points, either Guarded, Elevated, High, or Severe. The numerical points levels occasionally change, but the names of the levels are fixed.

OK/Guarded (0-74): An unexciting game.
GOOD/Elevated (75-174): Game is worth watching if the TV is already on.
HOT/High (175-274): This game is worth turning on the TV to watch.
EPIC/Severe (275+): Beg, borrow, and steal to get to a TV. This game will likely lead SportsCenter.
highPoints

The highPoints element is the highest numerical rating that the game has reached. In many cases, points and highPoints will end at the same value, but if a top-ranked team is being upset, and then pulls ahead late, the points value might drop far below the highPoints peak. This would also happen for a No-hit bid lost late in a baseball game.

playerID

Player IDs are permanent numbers assigned to each user, and like all of our other IDs, will never change.

price, price1, price2, value

This set of parameters is used to describe a prop or future bet in the SideOdds endpoint. price, price1, and price2 represent the payout for a correct wager in decimal format. Any of these parameters set to 1 represents a disabled wager. value represents the line for the bet.

price is shown by itself for a one-option outright bet, like a team winning the Super Bowl. price1 and price2 are displayed in tandem for a two-option Yes/No bet, like a team reaching the playoffs or whether a game will go into Overtime. price1 always represents Yes/Over and price2 always represents No/Under. value is shown with price1 and price2 to represent an Over/Under bet, displaying the numerical value of the line.

Here are a few examples:

Team to Win the Super Bowl
price: 2500
Team to Make the Playoffs
price1: 2.5, price2: 1.402
Over/Under for a Player's Points Scored in a Game
price1: 1.90909, price2: 1.90909, value: 24.5
progress

Progress is a numerical value, representing the amount of the game that has been completed. The start of a game is represented by 72, and the end of regulation is represented by 0. Extra/Over Time is represented by negative numbers.

56
Baseball: Top 3, Pro Basketball: 1st Q - 2:00, Pro Football: 1st Q - 2:30, College Basketball: 1st H - 8:53
36
Baseball: Mid 5, Hockey: 2nd P - 10:00, Basketball/Football: Half
-12
Baseball: Mid 11, Pro Basketball: OT - 4:00, Pro Football: OT - 5:00
reach

Reach is a numerical value from 0-100, representing the relative number of customers that can view a station. The higher the number, the more customers can be expected to have access to the station. Any value above 75 can be considered a national broadcast.

rationale

A comma-delimited list of reasons why a game is exciting. New rationales are added periodcally.

No-Hitter
Perfect Game
Overtime
Extra Innings
Extra Time
Upset
Individual Performance
Penalty Kicks
Ranked Teams (College Regular Season)
Top Teams (Playoffs, Tournaments)
score1, score2, team1, team2, location
The large majority of games involve two teams, but events like auto races will not. Throughout the API, the 1 index represents the away team and the 2 index represents the home team. For any such game with a "field", the location element will contain the name of the event, such as "Coca-Cola 600", and the score and team elements will be omitted.

timeLeft

This describes the amount of time left in the game, such as "3rd Quarter - 4:30", or "End of 1st". If the game is over, the value will be something like "Final" or "Final/2OT", and will always start with "Final". If the game has not yet started, the element will be empty in XML, and not included in JSON.

trails

This element is used in the stream API to allow plotting of excitement points as the game progresses. It is represented by a JSON Object, the keys of which are progress values. The value for each key is an object with the points, timeLeft, score1, score2, and date when the game was at the specified progress.

Prompt for Replit:

Redesign the Sign In page to look more like a modern fintech terminal, cleaner and more engaging.

Layout

Center the sign-in form in the viewport, inside a rounded card with subtle shadow (2xl, soft).

Use Sharp Shot Gold for the primary CTA button and hover states.

Background: keep the dark grid terminal background, but add a faint radial gradient (dark charcoal → near-black) to draw attention to the center.

Remove the giant “SIGN IN” headline; instead use a smaller sharp headline above the form: Access Your Terminal.

Subtext below headline: Your command center for betting intelligence.

Form Styling

Email + password inputs should be full width, with sharp rectangular edges (no deep rounding).

Add subtle inner glow on focus (gold border glow).

"Remember me" and "Forgot password?" inline, lighter gray.

Make the Sign In button bigger, bold, centered, full width.

Add hover effect: gold → brighter gold with subtle shimmer.

Extra Elements

Remove the floating terminal text (Value detected… +EV identified). Replace with a small animated terminal strip at bottom that cycles through lines like:

> Mapping field odds…

> Identifying +EV…

> Securing data feed…

These lines should type out like a terminal cursor animation, faint and non-intrusive.

Badges / Proof Points

Keep the “Data-Driven / Transparent / Secure” badges, but move them below the form in a single horizontal row with subtle iconography.

Top Nav

Keep the top nav minimal (Sharp Shot logo + Access Beta button).

Make “Sign In” in the nav inactive/disabled on this page.

Do you also want me to give you an alt version with a split-screen hero (terminal animation left, form right), so you have both layout styles ready to test?

Here’s a tighter, more complete prompt to feed Replit. It keeps the terminal/fintech vibe, fixes hierarchy, and specifies exact copy/behaviors.

Redesign the Sign In page for Sharp Shot. Modern fintech terminal aesthetic. Minimal, fast, confident.

Page structure

Full-bleed dark terminal grid background with a subtle center radial vignette (charcoal → near-black).

Single centered container, max-width 480px. Vertical center.

Remove the giant “SIGN IN” headline.

Header copy (above the form)

H2: “Access Your Terminal”

Subhead (one line, muted): “Your command center for betting intelligence.”

Sign-in card

Card: rounded-2xl, soft shadow, slight glass blur; padding 28–32px.

Inputs stacked with 12–14px gaps.

Labels small uppercase, letter-spaced; input text regular.

Email input placeholder: “Enter your email”

Password input placeholder: “Enter your password”

Add a password visibility toggle icon inside the field (right).

On focus: 1px Sharp Shot Gold border with faint outer glow.

Error state: thin red border + concise helper text below the field.

Aux row under fields

Left: checkbox “Remember me”.

Right: text link “Forgot password?” (muted; underline on hover).

Primary action

Full-width button: “Sign In”

Color: Sharp Shot Gold for default; hover = brighter gold + subtle shimmer; pressed = darker gold.

Disabled state if fields empty or during submit (show spinner inside the button).

Secondary actions (below primary)

Small line: “Don’t have an account? Create account” (link style).

Optional SSO buttons (stacked under a thin divider with “or”):

“Continue with Google”

“Continue with Discord”

Buttons are neutral dark with brand icon left; hover raises 2px, no color explosions.

Proof points (quiet, de-noised)

Single row under the card with three compact badges and micro-icons: “Data-Driven • Transparent • Secure”.

Keep spacing tight; badges use hairline borders, no heavy pills.

Terminal flavor (subtle, non-blocking)

At the very bottom of the viewport, a faint, looping typewriter strip (mono, 80% width, centered):

“> Mapping field odds…”

“> Identifying +EV…”

“> Securing data feed…”

2–3 lines, slow cycle, opacity ~60%, pauses on hover.

Top navigation

Left: Sharp Shot logo. Right: “Resources” and an “Access Beta” outline button in Sharp Shot Gold.

Current page’s “Sign In” item appears muted/inactive.

Responsiveness & spacing

Respect the 480px max; maintain comfortable line lengths.

Touch targets ≥44px height.

Reduce outer margins slightly on very small screens; keep card elevation consistent.

Accessibility

High contrast on text/buttons; visible focus rings (gold).

ARIA labels for form fields, password toggle, and error descriptions.

Form submits on Enter; prevent double-submit.

Copy (use exactly)

H2: Access Your Terminal

Subhead: Your command center for betting intelligence.

Labels: Email, Password

Checkbox: Remember me

Links: Forgot password? • Create account

Button: Sign In

SSO: Continue with Google • Continue with Discord

Badges: Data-Driven • Transparent • Secure

Empty/error/success behavior

If email or password is blank: disable Sign In.

On invalid credentials: show inline error under Password: “Email or password is incorrect.”

On submit: show button spinner and keep layout fixed (no jump).

Design language: sharp grid, confident typography, restrained animation, gold accents only for interactive/primary elements. No giant hero text, no noisy gradients, no extra copy. Clean, focused, fast.

Add scroll-driven animations to the “BUILT FOR PROFESSIONAL BETTORS” section (the three cards). Keep all copy and layout exactly the same. Use our existing brand tokens only (gold/charcoal/neutrals). Style = trading terminal, minimal.

How to build (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

Make the section a scroll scene

Wrap the three cards in a container about 150vh tall.

Inside, add a sticky wrapper (position: sticky; top: 0) so the cards “pin” while the user scrolls.

Use useScroll({ target: sceneRef, offset: ["start end", "end start"] }) and map scrollYProgress with useTransform.

Base reveal

When the scene enters, fade + lift the cards in with a short stagger (60–90ms between cards).

If prefers-reduced-motion is on, do opacity only (no movement).

Scroll animations per card (each gets its own range)

Card 1 — Spot Edges (progress 0.10 → 0.40)
• Mini-viz: a radar sweep rotates once (0→~540°) tied to progress.
• “40+ Books” does a quick count 40→42→44→“40+” across the same range.
• One ping dot appears and fades near 0.30 progress.

Card 2 — Systematize (progress 0.40 → 0.70)
• Mini-viz: two slider handles translate X a few px following progress.
• Near 0.65, flash a small checkmark above the track for ~250ms, then fade.

Card 3 — Collaborate (progress 0.70 → 1.00)
• Mini-viz: 4 nodes in a diamond. Draw connecting lines in sequence using strokeDashoffset mapped to progress, then briefly brighten lines toward our gold token at the end and settle.

Keep hover/focus

While pinned, hovering a card still lifts it 2–4px and warms the outline.

Keyboard focus triggers the same visual state.

Mobile fallback (<768px)

Skip sticky pinning.

Use simple “enter-on-view” reveals: fade + lift and a shortened version of each mini-viz that plays once.

Accessibility and performance

Respect prefers-reduced-motion everywhere (no rotation/translation; color changes only).

Visible focus rings.

Use lightweight inline SVG for mini-viz; no chart libraries; no layout shift; 60fps feel.

Deliverables

<ProBettorsScrollScene /> that manages the sticky scene and scrollYProgress.

<MiniViz type="edges|presets|collab" /> updated to read progress and animate as above.

Success check

Cards pin and animate smoothly on desktop; each card “has its moment” as you scroll.

Mobile uses non-sticky reveals.

Reduced-motion disables movement but keeps readable feedback.

No new colors; no jank.

Trading Terminal Frontend – Polish & Complete

We’ve got the table structure showing opportunities. Now refine it into the finished version.

1. Clean up Columns

Category column: instead of just “+EV” pill, give it a compact status tag. Example:

+EV (green accent)

Arb (purple accent, soon)

Middle (blue accent, soon)

Keep it subtle, not oversized.

Event column:

Show “Home vs Away” clearly.

Beneath, chips: league (e.g., MLB, NBA, etc.), live/prematch tag, and game start time.

Don’t show “Invalid Date” — format from backend properly (e.g., “Aug 18, 7:30 PM”).

Market column:

Example: “Moneyline – Astros” or “Spread – -1.5 Tigers.”

Keep it concise but clear.

Fair Odds column:

Show fair odds in American format.

Underneath, show “Hit %” (fair probability) if backend provides.

Tooltip: “Fair = no-vig price.”

EV% column:

Keep as is but improve formatting: +22.9% instead of long decimals.

Positive = green accent; negative = muted red/gray. Use theme tokens.

My Price column:

Show the selected book odds pill clearly (e.g., FanDuel +500).

Tooltip: list all selected book odds for this row.

If url exists, make pill clickable to book site.

Field Prices column:

Show 5–6 comp books inline as pills (e.g., DraftKings +425).

If more, show +N more with tooltip/drawer for the rest.

Dim mismatched lines; tooltip shows actual line.

Consensus column:

Show consensus odds (e.g., +407) and number of books (“22 books”).

If missing, show —.

Status column:

Format “less than a minute ago” consistently. Use relative timestamps (“34s ago,” “5m ago”).

Show Live vs Prematch as a colored chip.

Actions column:

Keep copy-to-clipboard and watchlist star.

Add hover tooltip labels (“Copy odds,” “Save to watchlist”).

2. Filters / Toolbar

Search bar: fix placeholder text to “Search teams or events…”

Dropdowns:

Markets → all prop types (Moneyline, Spread, Total, Team Total, etc.).

Status → Live, Prematch.

Books → multi-select (show logos).

EV% filter: slider with live update.

Add Reset button that clears all filters.

“Active: FanDuel” chip should support multiple active books. Show them inline with small book logos.

3. Row Expansion

Clicking a row should expand inline:

Full price ladder with every book.

Kelly suggestions (if backend provides).

History chart (tiny sparkline) of EV% if backend provides.

Only one open at a time. Collapse smoothly.

4. States

Fix Invalid Date → show proper formatted date/time or — if missing.

Empty state: “No opportunities match your filters.”

Error state: “Data unavailable, retry shortly.”

Loading: skeleton rows.

5. Interactions & Style

Sorting: default by EV% desc. Click column headers to change sort.

Hover: no underlines. Use brightness/letter-spacing pulse.

Odds pills: subtle lift on hover.

Table borders: very light dividers; keep it minimal, system-UI feel.

Keep all padding and row heights consistent.

6. Mobile Behavior

Collapse rows into stacked cards.

Top line: event + league + status.

Show EV%, My Price, and Field Prices.

Expand card to see full ladder and consensus.

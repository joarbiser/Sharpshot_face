SHARP SHOT — FULL FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
JULY 2025 | COPY-PASTE SAFE | FULL DETAIL | DO NOT DELETE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

PURPOSE:
This instruction set outlines all necessary frontend improvements for Sharp Shot’s real-time betting platform. This includes visual corrections, filter deployment, interaction polish, and clarity enhancements. This document assumes full retention of existing features — no functionality should be removed unless explicitly stated.

==========================================================================================
SECTION 1 — HERO SECTION: WHITE TEXT VISIBILITY AND COPY CLEANUP

1.1 PROBLEM: Inadequate text contrast in top hero area

The phrase “IT’S NOT LUCK.” is currently rendered in pure white (#FFFFFF) on a white background.

This text is nearly invisible to the human eye under normal screen brightness.

This issue appears on both desktop and mobile breakpoints.

1.2 ADDITIONAL VISUAL ISSUES:

Similar white-on-white or low-contrast text styling appears in multiple places across the site.

Other affected areas may include headings, section intros, pricing bullets, table columns, and mobile layouts.

These must be identified and corrected during implementation.

1.3 SOLUTION: Adjust typography contrast

Target class or ID: .hero-tagline-light or the specific h1 element containing “IT’S NOT LUCK.”

CSS fix option 1: Soft ghosted white
.hero-tagline-light {
color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
font-weight: 700;
letter-spacing: 0.03em;
}

CSS fix option 2: Branded soft gray for readability
.hero-tagline-light {
color: #B0B0B0;
font-weight: 700;
letter-spacing: 0.03em;
}

Optional background overlay to aid readability:
.hero-container::before {
content: "";
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03));
z-index: 0;
}

1.4 GLOBAL CONTRAST AUDIT:

The team must perform a comprehensive scan of the frontend for any other low-contrast or white-on-white visibility problems.

Prioritize readability across all devices and themes.

Apply consistent fixes using brand-consistent colors:

#B0B0B0 for low-emphasis text

#3B3B3D for high-contrast body text

#BA9A5B (Sharp Shot gold) for emphasis, never for body copy

1.5 COPY CLEANUP: Remove third line of tagline text

Current text to remove:
“Instantly identify profitable bets across sportsbooks — no guesswork, just edge.”

This line is redundant with the primary messaging and visually overcrowds the hero.

Comment it out or delete the paragraph in the hero section HTML.

Example:

==========================================================================================
SECTION 2 — LIVE SCORE BAR: HIDE BY DEFAULT, REVEAL ON HOVER

2.1 OBJECTIVE:

The persistent live score bar at the bottom of the viewport should only appear when a user hovers near the bottom edge of the screen.

This improves focus and declutters the page during normal use.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION:
Option A — Global hover detection:
CSS:
.live-score-bar {
position: fixed;
bottom: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
transform: translateY(100%);
transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
z-index: 999;
}
body:hover .live-score-bar {
transform: translateY(0%);
}

Option B — Controlled hover trigger:
HTML:

CSS:
.hover-zone {
position: fixed;
bottom: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 40px;
z-index: 998;
}
.hover-zone:hover + .live-score-bar {
transform: translateY(0%);
}

Ensure this does not interfere with mobile UX. Consider suppressing this behavior on touch devices using a media query:
@media (hover: none) {
.live-score-bar {
transform: translateY(0%) !important;
}
}

==========================================================================================
SECTION 3 — FILTER CONFIGURATION FOR CALCULATOR & VIEWS

==========================================================================================
SECTION 4 — TOOLTIP DEPLOYMENT FOR KEY TERMS

Add title="..." attributes or tooltip components for all of the following terms anywhere they appear on the site:

+EV:
"Positive expected value — profit potential over time based on odds inefficiency."

CLV:
"Closing Line Value — how much better your bet is compared to the final market line."

Book:
"The sportsbook offering this line."

Props:
"Player or team stat bets (e.g., yards, receptions, strikeouts)."

Totals:
"Combined point totals for a game."

Spreads:
"Margin-based bets on victory or loss."

Demo Mode:
"Try the platform with full features and no signup required."

==========================================================================================
SECTION 5 — CTA POLISH & BUTTON HOVERS

Ensure every CTA and button has clear interactive feedback. For desktop users, include scale or shadow effects on hover.

Example button hover effect:
button:hover {
transform: translateY(-1px);
box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

Also ensure all major CTA buttons (“Try Calculator”, “View Pricing”, “Create Account”) follow consistent width, font size, and alignment on mobile and desktop.

Optional: Add Sharp Shot gold gradient effect to highlight buttons
button.gold {
background: linear-gradient(90deg, #BA9A5B, #D4B072);
color: black;
}

==========================================================================================
SECTION 6 — PRIORITY ORDER OF EXECUTION

Remove third line of hero text

Add live score bar reveal behavior with hover logic

Build and group full calculator and views filter system

Add tooltips and hover titles for glossary terms

Apply hover states to all major buttons and CTAs

Add scroll-triggered animation (optional, after core is stable)

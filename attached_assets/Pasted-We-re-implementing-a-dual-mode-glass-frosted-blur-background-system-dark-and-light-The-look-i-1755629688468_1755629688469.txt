We’re implementing a dual-mode “glass + frosted blur” background system (dark and light). The look is modern fintech/crypto, restrained, premium. Replace the old gold gradient. Accents use Sharp Shot gold and Sharp Shot neon green—never as full-page fills.

Goals

Trading-terminal vibe in dark mode; clean SaaS vibe in light mode.

Transparent glass panels floating over a quiet background with subtle, almost imperceptible motion.

Sharp Shot gold is a primary accent in both modes; neon green is secondary for positive/“edge found” states.

Semantic color tokens (CSS variables—no hex values)

base: page background (dark: very dark neutral; light: off-white neutral)

ink: primary text (dark: high-contrast light; light: high-contrast dark)

muted: secondary text (dark: softened light; light: softened dark)

hairline: low-contrast lines/borders (dark: faint light; light: faint cool gray)

accent-gold: Sharp Shot gold

accent-green: Sharp Shot neon green

glass-fill: translucent surface color (mode-specific)

glass-border: thin, low-contrast border (mode-specific)

Dark mode (default)

Base backdrop: deep, low-contrast gradient from very dark neutral to slightly less dark. Add a soft radial vignette at the edges. Keep it quiet.

Optional finance texture: ultra-faint 1px grid (both axes) at hairline opacity; optional 2–3 faint vertical “chart panes.” These should be visible only if you look for them.

Optional micro-motion: a barely visible horizontal shimmer/ticker pass with a very long loop; disable for reduced motion.

Glass surfaces (cards/sections): translucent fill (dark neutral with transparency), backdrop blur in the mid-high teens, mild saturation boost, thin light border, subtle inner highlight at the top edge, soft downward shadow, generous (not bubbly) radius.

Hover/focus: slightly more blur, slightly deeper shadow, translate up 1–2px; show a crisp 2–3px outer ring in Sharp Shot gold at reduced opacity. Focus-visible gets a thicker ring for accessibility.

Text on glass: titles use ink, descriptions use muted; ensure strong contrast.

Light mode

Base backdrop: off-white neutral with a very soft radial vignette; keep it clean and minimal.

Optional finance texture: hairline cool-gray grid at extremely low opacity; optional faint vertical “chart panes.” Even subtler than dark mode.

Glass surfaces: semi-opaque white with backdrop blur (slightly lower than dark mode to avoid haze), mild saturation, thin cool-gray border, subtle inner highlight, restrained shadow to keep it airy.

Hover/focus: same pattern as dark mode. Focus ring uses Sharp Shot gold for consistency.

Text on glass: ink for titles, muted for descriptions; maintain strong contrast and avoid washed-out type against blur.

Accent usage (both modes)

Use Sharp Shot gold for: key numbers, important strokes/underlines, focus rings, CTA outlines, progress indicators, small badges, and “premium” highlights.

Use Sharp Shot neon green for: positive states, EV % highlights, success toasts, and “edge detected” signals.

Avoid large fills with either accent. Keep accents as precise lines, icons, rings, and micro-highlights.

Primary CTA: dark (in dark mode) or high-contrast neutral (in light mode) with a thin Sharp Shot gold outline; on hover, run a subtle sweep across the outline stroke; do not flood with color.

Secondary CTA: hairline border only; on hover, a faint glow or ring in Sharp Shot gold.

Shared glass system (applies to both modes)

backdrop-filter blur in the mid-high teens (tune per mode for clarity), subtle saturate, thin border (hairline token), inner highlight via inset top-edge treatment, soft shadow.

Performance: do not blur the entire page—only the panels. Use a single fixed .backdrop container for the base layers.

Reduced motion: disable shimmer and minimize hover translations.

Structure & placement

Add a top-level .backdrop (fixed, full viewport, z-index below content). Paint the base gradient + optional textures here.

Place content above. Key sections use glass panels:

Hero: a wide glass band behind the headline and primary CTA (text sits on glass, not raw background).

Three-feature row (“Spot Real-Time Edges”, etc.): each feature is a glass card using the shared spec.

Membership/plan strip: narrower glass band; underline the headline with a thin Sharp Shot gold rule.

Navigation: keep the app bar on raw base in both modes; give it a thin hairline bottom border. Active nav item gets a small Sharp Shot gold indicator (dot/underline), not a full bar.

Interactions & micro-details

On scroll, slightly reduce panel blur and strengthen the border to imply depth adjustment.

Icon hovers: 1px soft outer glow using the relevant accent (gold for primary, neon green for positive-state icons).

EV % color logic (if present here): below zero moves toward caution; near zero is neutral; positive leans toward Sharp Shot neon green. Keep this subtle on marketing pages (heavier usage inside the product).

Accessibility & legibility

Maintain ≥ WCAG AA contrast for text on glass in both modes. If text looks muddy, increase glass opacity or reduce background saturation behind it.

Focus-visible states must be obvious and consistent (gold ring), keyboard order unaffected by decorative layers.

Test the gold outline/glow against both backgrounds; tune opacity so it reads as premium, not gaudy.

Implementation steps (for the AI)

Create semantic CSS variables for both modes (no hard-coded hex). Provide a data-theme="dark|light" switch on the root.

Build a single .backdrop element with the base gradient + optional textures per mode.

Implement a .glass utility/class that applies the shared glass system. Allow variant modifiers for “band” (hero strip) and “card” (features).

Wire hover/focus styles for .glass and CTAs, using Sharp Shot gold rings and outline sweeps.

Add reduced-motion media query to disable shimmer/large translations.

Apply to the hero, three-feature row, and membership strip as first pass; keep the rest of the page unchanged for now.

Validate dark and light mode toggles across desktop, tablet, and mobile; adjust glass opacity per breakpoint if text clarity suffers.

Testing checklist

Safari backdrop-filter fallback: if unsupported, switch glass panels to semi-opaque fills with no blur; retain borders/highlights/shadows.

Re-check text contrast on both modes and in varied content density.

Confirm the gold ring and outline sweep are visible but restrained in both modes.

Confirm performance: no jank from fixed backdrop or blur on scroll; keep animations GPU-friendly.

Confirm reduced motion disables shimmer and reduces hover translations.

Keep it quiet, technical, and premium. In both light and dark modes, Sharp Shot gold is the signature accent; Sharp Shot neon green reinforces positive/edge states. The background supports the content—never competes with it.

Replace the expanded Compare features block with a two-column comparison that mirrors our Pricing card style. Keep the page background as is. Use our tokens (base, ink, muted, hairline) and accents (Sharp Shot gold, Sharp Shot neon green).

Structure

One large card container (same radius, hairline border, soft shadow as pricing cards).

Inside: two equal columns with a thin Sharp Shot gold vertical divider centered.

Tight top/bottom padding (about medium). No big header slab; keep a small subtitle only if needed.

Column headers

Micro pill above each title:

Pro → neutral pill with a tiny Sharp Shot neon green dot, label “Starting Smart”.

Unlimited → neutral pill with a tiny Sharp Shot gold dot, label “Scaling Up”.

Titles use ink. Price line uses the same typography as the pricing cards (price in ink, “/month” in muted, tight to the number).

One-line summary under each title (muted).

Content style

Each feature row = bold label + muted one-sentence explainer (concise but real).

Left of each row: small circular check (stroke hint only; no solid fill).

Row gap ~10–12px. Add a faint divider every ~4 rows.

End each column with a small “Best for” sub-card (same radius/border).

Spacing & behavior

Reduce vertical air overall; keep columns dense but readable.

“Compare features” pill stays centered above this card; chevron flips on open/close.

Expand/collapse uses a quick fade + small slide; no layout jump.

Ensure keyboard focus rings (Sharp Shot gold) are visible on the pill and links.

Acceptance

All items from the pricing cards are represented (no missing bullets).

Explanations are one sentence each, clearer and more specific.

Visual style matches the pricing cards (pills, checks, radius, border, shadow).

Dense, scannable, professional.

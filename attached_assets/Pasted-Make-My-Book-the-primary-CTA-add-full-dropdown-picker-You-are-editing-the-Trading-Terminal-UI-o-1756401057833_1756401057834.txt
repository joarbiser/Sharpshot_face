Make “My Book” the primary CTA + add full dropdown picker

You are editing the Trading Terminal UI only. No backend math. Treat “My Book” as the first action users must take.

What to change (visual hierarchy)

Promote “My Book” to primary CTA in the header:

Move it to the far right of the main header controls, before the gear icon.

Change its pill style to primary: slightly larger width/height than other pills, bold label, left-aligned book icon placeholder.

Add a subtle attention treatment until a book is chosen:

Soft pulse on the pill outline every ~4s, or a shimmering underline.

Tooltip on hover/focus: “Start here: pick your sportsbook to populate My Odds.”

When a book is selected, remove pulse and show the book’s mini badge inside the pill: [logo] SHORT.

Add first-run nudge:

If no selectedBookId, show a one-line banner just above the table: “Choose your book to populate My Odds.” Include a small button “Select My Book” that triggers the same picker. Hide this banner once a selection exists (persist hide in localStorage).

Dropdown picker (the missing piece)
3) On click of the header pill OR any row’s “Set My Book” cell, open a proper picker:

Desktop: anchored Popover under the pill, width ~420–520px, max-height ~60% of viewport with internal scroll.

Mobile: full-screen Sheet with a close “X”.

Picker contents:

Search input at top (debounced) filters by name/short.

Sections (render if data available):

“Pinned” (user favorites; leave empty for now).

“Recently used” (last 3 selections from localStorage).

“All books” (virtualized list/grid so it performs with many items).

Each item shows: logo (if provided), SHORT, full name. Click = set selectedBookId, close picker, write to localStorage.

Include a “Reset (Clear selection)” option at bottom left; right side has a “Done” button that closes without changes.

Empty state copy: “No books available.”

State & persistence
5) Store selectedBookId in a global UI store (Context or Zustand). Init from localStorage key ss:selectedBookId. Write back on change.
6) Also store ss:recentBooks (array of up to 5 ids) and update when a selection is made.

Table wiring (unchanged in scope, but verify)
7) “My Odds” column:

If selected and row has that book’s price: show price + tiny badge of the book (logo + short), right-aligned.

If selected but price missing: show muted “—”.

If not selected: show “Set My Book” hint text (clicking opens picker).

“Field Odds” must exclude the selected book automatically. Do not change the count of other book columns.

“Field Avg” remains “—” with a “pending backend” tooltip.

Keyboard & accessibility
10) Keyboard:
- “b” opens the picker, “Esc” closes.
- Arrow keys navigate list; Enter selects.
11) Focus management:
- Return focus to the pill after closing.
- Ensure ARIA roles: button for the pill, dialog for the popover/sheet, listbox with options for items, aria-selected on chosen book.

Layout & theming
12) Match existing spacing and typography; the primary pill is ~10–15% taller than secondary pills.
13) Light/dark modes:
- Use our existing surfaces. The primary pill uses an outline accent only; do not fill it with brand colors.
- Accents may use Sharp Shot Gold D8AC35 or Neon Green #00ff41 for the OUTLINE/ring and focus, not the text fill.
14) Responsiveness:
- If header width is tight, collapse pill label to icon + SHORT; keep tooltip accessible.

QA checklist
15) Confirm:
- Picker opens from header pill and row “Set My Book”.
- Selection persists on reload.
- Selected book is excluded from Field Odds everywhere.
- First-run banner disappears after selection.
- Keyboard shortcuts and focus work.
- Virtualized list scrolls smoothly with many books.
- Works in both themes and on mobile sheet.

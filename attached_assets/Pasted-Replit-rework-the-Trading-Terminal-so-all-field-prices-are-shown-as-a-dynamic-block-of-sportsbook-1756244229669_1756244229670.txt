Replit, rework the Trading Terminal so all “field” prices are shown as a dynamic block of sportsbook columns (one column per book), not a single “Field Odds” cell. Do not hardcode the number of book columns. This is front-end only.

Column order (base stays fixed):
Event | League | Prop | Market | My Odds | Win Probability | +EV% | Field Avg | [ Field Books … dynamic columns ]

How Field Books should work (dynamic):

Create a book registry (ids, display names, logo URLs). Render one column per book in the registry, in that order.

The number of columns comes from the registry length at runtime. If new books are added to the registry, they appear automatically; if a book isn’t in the registry but exists in the data, append it to the end (sorted by name) and log a warning so we can add it later.

Do not duplicate the My Odds book in the Field Books block. For that column, render a muted em dash (—) with tooltip: “Shown in My Odds; excluded from field.”

Each Field Book cell shows the price as a pill chip. If a given row has no quote for that book, render an em dash (—) with tooltip “No quote”.

Column header for each Field Book is the book logo with a tooltip of the full book name.

Widths & scrolling:

Keep the first 8 columns (up to Field Avg) sharing roughly 60% of the table width and sticky on horizontal scroll so Event/Prop stay visible.

Place the Field Books block to the right and allow horizontal scrolling to reveal however many book columns exist. No vertical wrapping in book cells.

Styling & behavior to keep:

League shows actual leagues (MLB, EPL, MLS, UFC, NCAAF, etc.); tooltip shows long name.

Event formatted “Away @ Home (YYYY-MM-DD h:mma z)” when possible; omit the parenthetical if time is unknown.

Prop labels normalized (no “O/U”, no “Home ML/Away ML”).

Win Probability: one decimal, 0–100%, right-aligned.

+EV%: leading “+” when positive; red→yellow→green color mapping; right-aligned with tabular numerals.

Field Avg: placeholder pill chip (value comes from backend later); right-aligned; tooltip “Field average across all other books (excludes My Odds).”

Accessibility & tooltips:

Use a tooltip portal so popovers don’t shift layout.

Headers and cells should be keyboard-focusable; add aria-sort on sortable headers.

QA checklist (what I expect):

After Field Avg, I see a dynamic sequence of book columns headed by logos; the count matches the registry (no hardcoding).

In any row, the My Odds book column shows a muted em dash (—) instead of repeating the price.

Horizontal scrolling reveals additional book columns; the first 8 columns remain sticky on the left.

Missing quotes show em dashes; no vertical wrapping inside book cells; tooltips work.

Column order exactly: Event | League | Prop | Market | My Odds | Win Probability | +EV% | Field Avg | [dynamic book columns].

Implement this dynamic Field Books block and show me a preview with several books present and at least one row where the My Odds book is correctly excluded from the field block.

Replit, update the Sign In page so it matches the About page system (badges, headings, cards, pills, spacing, and micro-interactions). Reuse existing tokens and components; don’t introduce new colors, fonts, or shadows.

Page frame

Use the same background treatment as About (dark base with subtle radial/angled glow and a faint gold accent).

Single centered stack with generous vertical spacing and the same max-width as the About page cards.

Header block (replace the current “LOGIN.” hero)

Add a badge pill at the top styled like About’s section pills: text = • SIGN IN.

H1 uses the same headline style and size as “ABOUT SHARP SHOT.”; text = SIGN IN.

Subhead below in muted body style: Access your terminal — built for sharps, not edge-seekers.

Optional value pills row under the subhead, same style as “Core Values” pills: Data-Driven • Transparent • Secure.

Layout

Two-column on desktop:

Left: brief credibility bullets with a faint, oversized mark in the background (same treatment as About). Bullets:

Precision over luck

Real-time odds analysis

Professional-grade tools

Right: the form card (see below).

On mobile: collapse to single column; header then form card; pills can wrap or horizontally scroll.

Form card (match About cards exactly)

One container with the same radius, border, shadow, and padding as the “Problem/Solution” cards.

Inside order:

Field label: Email

Input: email

Field label: Password

Input: password

Row: [ ] Remember me on the left, Forgot password? link on the right (muted; underline on hover)

Primary CTA button full width: Sign In

Divider line (same subtle rule used on About)

Small centered text: Don’t have an account? then inline link Create account

Inputs: thin border, slight inset shadow; on focus show a faint gold ring. Error state uses the site’s danger tone with a short helper line below the field.

Checkbox uses site checkbox styling with a small gold check when selected.

Support strip (below the card)

Muted sentence with small lock icon if available:
Questions about your account? Contact support.
“Contact support” links to the Support page (not mailto).

Buttons and links

Primary button matches global CTA: solid gold; hover = quick, subtle shimmer sweep; active = brief pressed state. Disabled = reduced opacity with readable label.

Text links use muted color; hover adds a faint gold underline only.

Motion and micro-interactions

Inputs and buttons use 150–200ms ease transitions; no bounce.

Form card fades and lifts slightly on mount (same motion curve as About sections).

Accessibility and responsiveness

Maintain the same contrast rules used on About for body, placeholders, helper, and error text.

Ensure keyboard focus order: Email → Password → Remember me → Sign In → Forgot password → Create account.

Keep spacing scale identical to About (no custom paddings).

Final copy (use exactly)

Badge: • SIGN IN

H1: SIGN IN

Subhead: Access your terminal — built for sharps, not edge-seekers.

Left bullets: Precision over luck / Real-time odds analysis / Professional-grade tools

Field labels: Email, Password

Checkbox: Remember me

Primary CTA: Sign In

Links: Forgot password? and Create account

Support line: Questions about your account? Contact support.

Make these changes without altering global tokens. The end result should visually read as the same design system used on the About page.

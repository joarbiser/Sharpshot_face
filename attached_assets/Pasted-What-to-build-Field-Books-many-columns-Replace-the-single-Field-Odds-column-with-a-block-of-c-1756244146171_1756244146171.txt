What to build:

Field Books = many columns

Replace the single “Field Odds” column with a block of columns, one per sportsbook.

Header for each of these columns is the book logo (and a tooltip with the full name).

Cell value = that book’s price for the exact prop, shown as a pill chip. If no quote, show an em dash (—).

Do NOT duplicate the My Odds book

Keep the My Odds column as-is (one price from the user-selected book).

In the Field Books block, do not repeat that same book’s price. For that column’s cells, render a muted em dash (—) with a tooltip “Shown in My Odds; excluded from field.”

We keep the column visible so the grid stays aligned row-to-row.

Config-driven book order

Create a constant BOOK_ORDER array with the books we support (ids, names, logo URLs).

Render Field Book columns in exactly this order every time (e.g., DK, FD, MGM, Caesars, BetRivers, Bet365, ESPN, Unibet, PointsBet, etc.).

We can add/remove books by editing BOOK_ORDER without touching table code.

Widths & scrolling

Keep the first 8 columns (up to Field Avg) sharing ~60% of the width (even split).

The Field Books block can be wider than the viewport. Wrap the entire table in a horizontal scroll container.

Make the first 8 columns sticky on horizontal scroll (so users can scroll the book columns while Event/Prop stay visible). Sticky left boundary should account for the combined width of those 8 columns.

Row height & wrapping

Each book cell is single line, no vertical wrapping.

If text would wrap, truncate (it won’t—prices are short).

Tooltips must render in a portal so they don’t push layout.

Field Avg column (placeholder)

Lives right before the Field Books block.

Shows a pill chip (value comes from backend later).

Tooltip: “Field average across all books except My Odds.”

Formatting rules to keep

League = actual league codes (MLB, EPL, MLS, UFC, NCAAF, etc.), tooltip long name.

Event = “Away @ Home (YYYY-MM-DD h:mma z)” when we have a valid time; otherwise omit the parentheses.

Prop strings normalized (no “O/U”, no raw “spread” wording).

Win Probability: one decimal, 0–100%, right-aligned.

+EV%: leading “+” when positive; color map (≤−2% red, ≥+3% green, blend in between); right-aligned with tabular numerals.

My Odds: one chip; tooltip “{Book} — {Price} • updated {relative time}”.

QA checklist (what I expect to see)

After Field Avg, I see a horizontal line of book columns, each headed by a logo.

For any row, the My Odds book column shows a muted em dash (—) instead of repeating the price.

Horizontal scrolling reveals more book columns; the first 8 columns stay sticky on the left.

No vertical wrapping in book cells; tooltips appear above the table.

Column order exactly: Event | League | Prop | Market | My Odds | Win Probability | +EV% | Field Avg | [book columns…].

Please implement this and show me a preview with:

8 base columns + 10 book columns (logos in headers).

One row where My Odds = DraftKings −110 and the DK column in the book block shows a muted “—” with the “Shown in My Odds” tooltip.

Another row that has missing quotes for two books (show em dashes there).

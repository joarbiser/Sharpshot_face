Prompt for Replit — Fix column order + add Field Odds

Replit, I need you to fix our Trading Terminal table. This is front-end only, React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Don’t calculate EV or probabilities here, just display what the backend gives us. Respect light/dark mode and our theme tokens, no hardcoded hex.

Here’s what to do:

Column order must be exactly this, nothing else:
Event | League | Prop | Market | My Odds | Win Probability | +EV% | Field Odds

Add the Field Odds column.
This should show every other book’s price for the same prop (all except the book that appears in “My Odds”).

Each item should be a chip with the book logo + price, inline.

If there are too many, wrap to the next line. On hover, allow horizontal scroll.

Tooltip: “{book name} — {price} • updated {relative time}”.

Make sure the book shown in My Odds is excluded here.

My Odds column.

Show only the single user-selected book’s price.

Render as a pill chip with a subtle border.

Tooltip: “{book name} — {price} • updated {relative time}”.

Win Probability column.

It’s wrong right now (showing 6500.0%). Fix formatting.

If value is 0–1, multiply by 100. If already 1–100, keep it. Clamp 0–100.

Always render with one decimal, e.g. “58.7%”.

Right-align. Tooltip: “Consensus fair win probability (excludes My Odds).”

+EV% column.

Show a leading “+” for positives.

Right-align with monospaced tabular numerals.

Color rules: ≤ −2% = solid red; ≥ +3% = solid green; between = smooth gradient red → yellow → green (text only, no heavy backgrounds).

Prop labels.

Never show “O/U 9”, “-1.5 spread”, “Home ML” or “Away ML”.

Always use full, natural names:

“Under 9.0” or “Over 9.0”

“Yankees −1.5”

“Celtics Moneyline”

“Jayson Tatum Over 5.5 Rebounds”

Normalize these strings in the adapter before rendering.

League and Market labels.

League should be proper case: “NBA”, “NFL”, “MLB”, “NCAAF”, “MMA”, “Soccer”.

Market should be clear: “Total Points” (not “Total”), “Point Spread” (not “Spread”), “Moneyline”, “Player Rebounds”, etc.

Map and clean these in the adapter.

Event label.

Do not show “(Invalid Date)”.

Format: “Away @ Home (YYYY-MM-DD h:mma z)”.

If date can’t parse, omit it entirely.

Tooltip: “Tipoff: {ISO timestamp}”.

Field Odds chips.

Logo 14px square + price text.

Tooltip same as above.

Sort chips by best price for that side/number if possible; otherwise keep API order.

Slightly lighter style than My Odds so it’s clear My Odds is the main value.

Alignment and formatting.

Right-align numeric columns (My Odds, Win Probability, +EV%).

Use monospaced/tabular numbers for consistency.

Text columns left-align with ellipses overflow; full value on tooltip.

Columns should look evenly spaced.

Filters and search.

Search bar should debounce by 250–400ms.

Filter chips for League and Market should show selected values.

Empty state if nothing matches: “No opportunities match your filters. Clear filters or try a different league/market.”

Table behavior.

Sticky header stays on scroll.

Virtualization supports 10k rows smoothly.

Add a skeleton loader for first load and subtle row shimmer when refreshing.

Sorting should work on Event, League, Market, My Odds, Win Probability, +EV%.

Accessibility.

Add aria-sort on sortable headers.

Focus rings for headers and chips.

Tooltips accessible via keyboard.

QA checklist:

No “Invalid Date” anywhere.

Props are natural English, not shorthand.

Win Prob never exceeds 100%, shows one decimal.

+EV% shows a plus sign when positive and uses proper color.

My Odds shows one price only; its book is not in Field Odds.

Field Odds chips show logos + prices + tooltips, wrap/scroll correctly.

Header sticky, scroll smooth, empty/skeleton states working.

Make all of these fixes and show me the updated table with a few realistic test rows (MLB Total, NBA Spread, MMA Moneyline, and a Player Rebounds example) so I can check the formatting.

Goal

Build a Sharp Shot “Product” page that explains the core product clearly to first-time visitors and converts them with a single strong primary CTA. Keep the aesthetic minimal, modern, and “system/tech” via structure, spacing, separators, and micro-interactions—not heavy visuals. Use clean layout, subtle motion, and concise copy. Avoid underlines-on-hover for nav/text; use subtle weight/letter-spacing or brightness pulses instead.

Page Layout (top → bottom)

Sticky Top Bar / Navigation

Left: brand wordmark (no prompt symbol).

Center/right: nav items (Home, Trading Terminal, Presets, Views, Learn, Pricing, Affiliate, About, Contact).

Active item uses a small dot indicator. On hover, replace overlines/underlines with a light “pulse” (slight brighten) or micro weight/letter-spacing change. No jitter.

Right end: one primary CTA button (“Get Started Free”) with a ghost/outline style; on hover do a quick, subtle shimmer sweep. Secondary action appears later in hero, not in the top bar.

Hero (Product Promise)

Left column: headline and subhead that read like a clear value prop for serious bettors.

Headline: “Bet with the edge, not a hunch.”

Subhead (short): “Sharp Shot finds +EV, arbitrage, and middling opportunities across major sportsbooks and shows exactly how to size your bets.”

Primary CTA: “Get Started Free”

Small line under CTA: “30 days free for beta testers.”

Secondary inline text link near the CTA: “See how it works” (scrolls to the “How It Works” section).

Right column: product preview frame—clean terminal-style UI mock (no live data necessary). Include tabs or a mini-viewport that hints at: Filters, Results Table, and a Bet Sizing panel.

Quick Feature Cards (3-up)

Three concise cards with icon + title + one-sentence blurb:

“+EV Bets” — “Remove the vig, compute true odds, and surface statistically positive opportunities.”

“Arbitrage” — “Exploit price discrepancies to lock in profit regardless of outcome.”

“Middles” — “Capitalize on line gaps where both sides can potentially win.”

Cards are clickable; each opens a small in-page explainer (expand/collapse) rather than navigating away.

How It Works (Step-by-Step)

4 steps in a horizontal/stacked layout:

“Choose your filters” — Select books, markets, min EV, hold thresholds, time windows.

“We remove the vig & evaluate” — Convert odds → implied probability, remove margin, compute expected value.

“See the opportunities” — Sorted results with market, line, fair odds, EV%, and confidence context.

“Bet sizing guidance” — Show recommended stake (with optional Kelly fraction), unit sizing, and risk notes.

Each step has: short headline, 1–2 sentences, and a tiny terminal-style micro-illustration (simple shapes/lines, no heavy artwork).

Add a “View an example” toggle under the section that reveals a single bet row example with labeled fields (Team/Market, Sportsbook, Line/Odds, Fair Odds, EV%, Suggested Stake).

Deeper Feature Detail (2-column sections)

Section A: “Filters & Presets”

Left: copy: “Save presets, fork community ones, and auto-apply last used filters. Collaborate privately or share publicly.”

Right: small UI mock: filter chips (Sportsbook, Market, EV%, Time, League), a “Save Preset” button, and a tiny “followers” badge for public presets (read-only).

Section B: “Results Table Built for Decisions”

Left: small UI mock of a table with sortable headers and “book priority sorting” hint (preset-weighted sorting).

Right: copy bullets (concise):

Fair odds & EV% after vig removal

Market depth/context tooltips

One-click copy for odds/lines

Quick links to supported books

Section C: “Bet Sizing & Risk”

Left: copy explaining optional Kelly fraction, unit sizing, and conservative modes (e.g., half-Kelly).

Right: minimal formula card: inputs (edge, bankroll), output (recommended stake). Note: do not show math derivation here—only a user-friendly summary.

Plans Overview (inline summary card)

Present a compact, comparison-style summary (NOT the full Pricing page; just a preview). Keep it scannable and honest:

Pro: include the Pro features the team defined (auto-save last filters, book priority sorting via Preset Editor, public preset follower count, creator bio on public presets, community highlights tab, preset “fork,” invite collaborators to private presets).

Unlimited: everything in Pro + unlimited preset sharing, unlimited collaborators, priority support (on-demand founder calls upon request).

CTA under the comparison: “See full pricing & details” (links to Pricing page).

Social Proof / Trust Signals

A slim bar with a text carousel or grid: short quotes from early users (placeholder copy) and logos for “As seen in” (placeholders). Keep it understated.

Microcopy option: “Built for sharps, not edge-seekers.”

FAQ (accordion)

Keep answers short, link to Learn/Tutorials for deep dives.

Include non-member questions too (e.g., “Do I need an account to ask questions?” → “No. Email support any time—members and non-members.”).

Suggested entries:

“How do you calculate +EV?”

“What is ‘removing the vig’ and why does it matter?”

“Do you support arbitrage and middling on all books?”

“How accurate are the ‘fair odds’?”

“Can I share presets and collaborate?”

“What if I’m totally new to betting analytics?”

Support CTA (friendly + accessible)

Short block above the footer:

Heading: “Questions? Ask us like you’d talk to a person.”

Body: “Whether you’ve signed up or not, send questions and we’ll help.”

Button: “Contact Support” → opens a simple conversational form modal (see “Support Form” requirements below).

Footer

Minimal brand area (left), quiet tagline (right).

Links grouped with subtle dividers; small social icons row.

Keep the “system/tech” feel from alignment, spacing, separators, and micro-interactions—not from flashy logo treatments.

Interactions & Motion (subtle)

Nav hover: Replace underlines with either a slight brightness pulse or tiny weight/letter-spacing change. Active uses a small dot indicator (solid); hover can use a “light” dot that fills on active.

Buttons: Ghost/outline style; hover shimmer sweep that completes in <0.5s. No bouncing or aggressive easing.

Cards: On hover, lift a few px with softer shadow; title brightens very slightly.

Accordions: Smooth expand/collapse with short duration and minimal overshoot.

Logo: Optional minimal hover animations (choose one): quick scanline pass, faint specular “glisten,” or micro-tilt—keep duration short and non-repeating.

Copy (use these exact strings unless noted)

Hero H1: “Bet with the edge, not a hunch.”

Hero subhead: “Sharp Shot finds +EV, arbitrage, and middling opportunities across major sportsbooks and shows exactly how to size your bets.”

Primary CTA (global): “Get Started Free”

Secondary inline text link: “See how it works”

Under primary CTA (small): “30 days free for beta testers.”

Filters & Presets blurb: “Save presets, fork community ones, and auto-apply last used filters. Collaborate privately or share publicly.”

Bet Sizing & Risk blurb: “Use optional Kelly fractions for disciplined staking, or choose conservative unit sizing.”

Trust line: “Built for sharps, not edge-seekers.”

Support block heading: “Questions? Ask us like you’d talk to a person.”

Support block body: “Whether you’ve signed up or not, send questions and we’ll help.”

Support Form (modal)

The form must feel conversational, not bureaucratic.

Fields:

“Your email”

“What can we help with?” (multi-line; placeholder suggests plain English)

Optional dropdown: “Topic” (General, Billing, Presets/Filters, Data/Books, Getting Started)

Checkbox: “Send me a copy”

On submit: send to support@sharpshotcalc.com. Show a human-friendly confirmation message (“Got it—we’ll get back to you shortly.”). No captcha walls. Graceful error state with retry.

Content Architecture & Reuse

Keep Product page self-contained but link out to:

Learn/Tutorials for deep explanations.

Pricing for full plan details.

Views (public strategy/presets) for social proof and discovery.

Reuse a simple “stat line” component for EV/fair-odds explanations when needed.

Accessibility & UX Notes

High contrast and clear focus states (no reliance on color alone).

Keyboard navigable accordions and modals.

Clear, non-jargon labels; tooltips can carry the jargon.

Respect reduced-motion settings (disable shimmer/scanline if user prefers reduced motion).

Technical Implementation Notes

Do not hardcode specific colors, font families, or font sizes. Pull from the existing design tokens/theme.

Keep components atomic and reusable: Hero, FeatureCards, HowItWorks, FeatureDetail, PlansPreview, TrustBar, FAQ, SupportCTA, SupportModal.

Keep all hover effects strictly on the text or component (no global underlines).

Ensure the “See how it works” link smooth-scrolls to the How It Works section.

Defer any heavy assets; no external requests beyond what’s necessary for existing icon sets.

Acceptance Checklist

No underline/overline hovers; use pulse or weight/letter-spacing change.

Dot indicator for active nav; light → filled behavior works as discussed.

Hero has one strong primary CTA and a secondary text link; microcopy about 30-day free beta present.

Three feature cards expand inline; no page navigation.

How It Works has 4 steps and a single example row toggle.

Presets/Filters, Results Table, and Bet Sizing sections present with concise copy and simple mocks.

Plans preview links to Pricing; Unlimited mentions priority support without operational promises beyond “on-demand founder calls upon request.”

Support CTA visible and clear; modal form emails support@sharpshotcalc.com; allows non-members to ask questions.

Footer is minimal with socials, structured links, and subtle separators.

All motion is subtle, quick, and can be reduced for accessibility.

Build exactly this page flow and copy. Keep it minimal, sharp, and consistent with the rest of the site’s “system UI” feel.

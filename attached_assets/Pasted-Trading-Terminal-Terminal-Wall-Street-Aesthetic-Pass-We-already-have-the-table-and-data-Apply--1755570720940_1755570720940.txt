Trading Terminal – Terminal/“Wall Street” Aesthetic Pass

We already have the table and data. Apply these UI/UX changes. No new colors or fonts—use our theme tokens. No underlines on hover. Keep everything fast and minimal.

1) Global look

Switch this page to the dark terminal theme (existing dark tokens). Background = surface-0; table container = surface-1; header/toolbar = surface-2.

Reduce vertical whitespace globally (tight, pro). Target row height ~compact (no numbers—use our compact density token).

Use a monospace digit font (system/mono stack) for numeric columns only (EV%, odds, % Hit, consensus, timestamps). Keep labels in normal UI font.

Add a subtle 1px grid between rows/columns (divider token). No heavy boxes.

On hover over a row: left-edge accent bar appears (accent token), slight lift, and brighter text—no shadows.

2) Header + toolbar

Replace the big white KPI tiles with slim “blotter counters”: inline chips (Books, +EV, Arb, Mid). Each is a pill with tiny icon + number. No card shadows.

Keep Refresh/Pause on the right; make Refresh primary (outline) and Pause quiet.

Filters bar stays, but tighten spacing. Chips/inputs use compact size. “Active: [book chips]” supports multiple books and allows ✕ to remove.

3) Table shape

Use a true table (already present). Lock column order and alignments:

Category (left, narrow): small pill: +EV. (Arb/Middle soon—do nothing now.)

Event (left, wide): “Away vs Home”. Subline chips: LEAGUE, PRE/LIVE, start time (formatted; never show “Invalid Date”).

Prop (left, medium): “Moneyline”, “Total”, “Spread”… If side/line exists, show concise form: “Over 2.5”, “-1.5”.

Hit % (right, narrow): from backend fair probability. Format to one decimal (“58.9%”). Monospace digits.

+EV % (My Books) (right, narrow): from backend evPct. Traffic-light color:

≤ –2%: solid red

–2 → 0: fade red → orange

0: yellow

0 → +3: fade yellow → green

≥ +3: solid green
Text only (optionally a very subtle translucent pill). Tooltip explains the scale.

My Odds (left, medium): show the primary selected-book price pill (BOOK +odds). If url exists, the pill is clickable. Tooltip lists all selected-book prices for this row.

Fair Odds (right, narrow): American fair price (e.g., “-105”). Subline (smaller): “Fair = no-vig”.

Field Odds (left, flexible): 5–6 book pills inline. If more, show “+N” pill; click opens drawer with full list. If a pill is a different line, dim it and show the line in tooltip.

Consensus (right, narrow): show median/consensus price plus count: “+274 • 25 books”. Remove the tiny bar sketch; text only.

Status (right, narrow): PRE/LIVE chip + relative time (“34s ago”, “2m ago”). No “0s”; cap at “<5s ago”.

All numeric columns are right-aligned; everything else left-aligned. Keep columns resizable if supported; if not, use sensible fixed widths.

4) Interactions & motion

Sorting: default by +EV % (desc). Numeric sort only. Header shows tiny chevron.

On data refresh, flash updated cells for ~400ms with a faint highlight (respect reduced motion).

Row expand: chevron at far left. Expanded panel shows full price ladder grouped by identical lines; Kelly suggestions and EV history only if backend sends them. One row open at a time.

Tooltips:

EV%: “Expected value for your selected book(s) vs fair odds. Red = negative, Yellow = neutral, Green = positive.”

Dimmed field pill: show book, odds, and its line.

5) Fix incorrect bindings (seen in screenshot)

EV% column must read row.evPct (decimal) → format as signed percent with one decimal. Do not show odds values in EV%.

Hit % must read row.fairProb → percent with one decimal.

Fair Odds must read row.fairOdds (American), not a percent.

“Invalid Date” → replace with formatted start time or “—” if missing.

Status relative time: compute once per tick; don’t display decimals (“1.3s”). Use whole seconds/minutes.

6) Price pill design (sporty/terminal)

Compact height, medium radius. Monospace odds inside. Book code acronym first (FAN, DK, MGM…).

Selected “My Odds” pill has a thin outline (accent) to stand out. Field pills are neutral until hover.

On hover: pill lifts slightly; text brightens; no glow.

7) Density & readability controls

Add a Density switch in “More”: Comfortable / Compact. Default = Compact.

Add “Columns” in “More”: allow toggling Consensus and Field Odds if user wants a minimal view.

8) Mobile

Cardize each row: top line Event + +EV%; second line Prop; third line: My Odds + first 3 Field pills; expand to see Hit %, Fair, Consensus, Status. Keep all pills tappable.

9) Acceptance checklist

Dark terminal visual applied; compact density; subtle grid; mono digits for numbers.

Column mapping correct; no “Invalid Date”; EV% and Hit % formatted as percents; Fair Odds as American.

EV% traffic-light colors obey: solid red ≤ –2%, yellow at 0, solid green ≥ +3% with smooth fades between.

My Odds shows selected book(s) only; Field Odds shows others with +N drawer; different lines are visibly dimmed and labeled in tooltip.

Consensus shows value and book count; no micro charts.

Sorting, hover pulses, row expand, and refresh flash all work. Respect reduced motion.

Mobile layout clean and tappable.

Make these changes exactly. Keep it sleek, fast, and professional—more “trading desk” than marketing site.

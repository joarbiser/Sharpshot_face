Prompt to Fix Odds Table Alignment, Add Book Logos, and Fix Glitchy Image Rendering
You are working within an existing Replit sports odds project using Tailwind CSS and React. The odds comparison table is already set up, but you must fix the layout and UI as follows:

üß© FIX #1: Odds Row Alignment
Ensure all odds values (including "AVG") appear in the same row, horizontally aligned with the EV%, probability, and sportsbook data.

Do not place "AVG" on its own row. Instead, treat it like any other sportsbook and render its odds as a regular odds cell, with a distinctive style (e.g., bg-green-900 text-green-300).

Match the spacing and height of all other odds cells.

üß© FIX #2: Add Sportsbook Logos Above Odds
Add sportsbook logo images above each odds value inside the odds grid.

Logos are stored in the following folder:
/public/booklogos/

File names match the sportsbook names in lowercase, no spaces (e.g. fanduel.png, betonline.png, draftkings.png).

Render the logos above the odds text using this structure:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-1">
  <img src={`/booklogos/${bookName.toLowerCase()}.png`} alt={bookName} class="h-5 w-auto object-contain" onError={(e) => e.target.style.display='none'} />
  <span>{odds}</span>
</div>
Add onError to prevent broken/glitchy images from showing a blank icon if the file isn't found.

üß© FIX #3: Prevent Glitchy Icons
Some logos flash or glitch when loading. Fix this by:

Adding the object-contain and h-5 w-auto classes to prevent distortion.

Add a fallback onError handler to hide broken images.

üß© FIX #4: Maintain Responsive and Existing Styles
Do not break or overwrite the current logic or layout styling.

Ensure odds comparison row uses flex or grid to keep odds cells aligned.

Maintain conditional formatting (highlighting best odds, EV%, etc.).

If using grid, make sure columns stay aligned even when some books are missing.

‚úÖ Final Goal:
The odds table must:

Show all odds (including ‚ÄúAVG‚Äù) in one aligned row.

Display the sportsbook logo above the odds number, glitch-free.

Maintain responsiveness and style.

Not affect existing interactivity or backend logic.

**Replit Task: Implement Sports Betting Trading Terminal**

Create a React-based trading terminal that:

1. **Fetches data from AreYouWatchingThis API** (XML format)
   - Endpoint: `https://sharpshot.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/games.xml?apiKey=3e8b23fdd1b6030714b9320484d7367b`
   - Odds endpoint: `https://sharpshot.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/api/odds.xml?apiKey=3e8b23fdd1b6030714b9320484d7367b&gameID={id}`

2. **Implements correct EV calculation** using Pinnacle formula:
   ```
   EV = (Probability of Winning × Amount Won per Bet) – (Probability of Losing × Amount Lost per Bet)
   ```
   - Convert decimal odds to American odds first
   - Calculate implied probability from American odds
   - Amount Won = Actual Payout - Stake
   - Amount Lost = Stake ($100 default)

3. **Layout exactly matches this structure:**
   - Top header: Trading Terminal title + action buttons (All Bets, +EV, Arbitrage, Middling)
   - Filter bar: Sport dropdown, Market Type dropdown, Game Status dropdown, EV slider (-20% to +10%), Sportsbook filter
   - Main table with columns: Event, Sport, Bet Type, Market, Line, Implied Prob, EV%, Preferred, then one column per sportsbook
   - Event column shows: Team names, sport icon, live score (if live), status badge
   - Sportsbook columns show: Book logo in header, line/total, American odds, implied probability

4. **Data processing:**
   - Parse XML responses for games and odds
   - Remove duplicates based on event+market+side+line combination
   - Sort: Live events first, then upcoming, then ended, then by highest EV
   - Filter by user selections (sport, market type, status, EV threshold, preferred book)

5. **Real-time features:**
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
   - Live score display for active games
   - Status badges: Live (green pulsing), Upcoming (blue), Ended (gray)
   - Clickable odds that redirect to sportsbook websites

6. **Color coding for EV:**
   - Purple (>10%): Very high EV
   - Emerald (2-10%): High/Good EV
   - Amber (-5% to 2%): Neutral
   - Orange (-10% to -5%): Poor
   - Rose (<-10%): Bad

7. **Supported sportsbooks with logos:**
   Bet Rivers, Bet365, DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, ESPN BET, Caesars, Unibet, William Hill, SugarHouse, Sportingbet, Sports Interaction, BetOnline, Bovada, Fanatics, PuntNow, SportsZino, SportTrade, Pinnacle

8. **Error handling:**
   - Loading states, error messages, empty states
   - Null checks for all data access
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing data

The terminal must use real API data (no synthetic/demo data), calculate EV correctly using the provided formula, and display all betting opportunities in an organized, scrollable table that prioritizes live events and positive EV opportunities.

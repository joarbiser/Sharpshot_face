A
Arbitrage Betting (Arb)
A betting strategy where you place bets on all possible outcomes of an event at different sportsbooks to lock in a guaranteed profit due to discrepancies in odds. Sharp Shot’s Arbitrage tools instantly calculate optimal stake sizes so both bets cover the spread of outcomes.

Against the Spread (ATS)
A wager on whether a team will cover the point spread set by the sportsbook, not just whether they win or lose.

Average Closing Line Value (CLV)
A measure of how your betting odds compare to the final odds offered before the event starts (the “closing line”). Positive CLV indicates you beat the market — a key sign of long-term profitability.

B
Bankroll
The total pool of money you’ve set aside strictly for betting. Sharp bankroll management means sizing bets as a percentage of this amount to protect against swings.

Bet Slip
The digital ticket on a sportsbook platform where you enter your selections, stake, and confirm the bet.

Book / Sportsbook
A company or platform that accepts and pays out wagers on sporting events. Sharp Shot compares odds across multiple books to find the best price.

C
Cash Out
An option allowing you to settle a bet before the event finishes, locking in a smaller profit or reduced loss.

Closing Line
The final odds available right before an event begins. Often considered the most accurate market prediction.

Cover
When a team beats the point spread (favorite wins by more than the spread, or underdog loses by less than the spread or wins outright).

D
Decimal Odds
A format common outside the U.S. showing the total payout (including stake) for each $1 wagered.

Draw
A tied outcome in a match or event, common in soccer and combat sports markets.

E
Edge
The percentage advantage a bettor has over the sportsbook after removing the vig. Sharp Shot calculates this to highlight value bets.

Expected Value (+EV)
The projected average profit or loss from a bet if it were placed many times. A +EV bet has positive long-term profitability.

F
Favorite
The side expected to win, indicated by negative odds in American format (e.g., -150).

Futures Bet
A long-term wager on an event’s outcome decided later in a season, such as the winner of the Super Bowl.

H
Handle
The total amount of money wagered on a game or event across all bets.

Handicap (Spread Betting)
A method of balancing competition between two teams by assigning a virtual advantage (+ points/goals) to the underdog or a virtual disadvantage (– points/goals) to the favorite before play starts.

Favorite with – handicap: Must win by more than the handicap number.

Underdog with + handicap: Can lose by less than the handicap number or win outright for the bet to cash.
Sharp Shot flags handicap markets where the odds present +EV after vig removal.

I
In-Play / Live Betting
Placing bets after an event has started, with odds updating in real time as the game progresses.

Implied Probability
The probability of an outcome derived from the odds, adjusted once the vig is removed.

J
Juice (Vig)
The sportsbook’s built-in commission, included in all odds to ensure their edge over the bettor. Sharp Shot strips this out when calculating true odds.

K
Kelly Criterion
A mathematical formula used to determine optimal bet size based on your edge and odds. Often used for bankroll growth over the long term.

L
Line
The odds or spread a sportsbook sets for a market.

Live Odds Feed
Real-time updating of odds from multiple sportsbooks, displayed in Sharp Shot’s Trading Terminal.

M
Middling
Placing bets on opposite sides of a game at different lines, aiming for a middle result that wins both bets. Sharp Shot’s Middling feature calculates exact stake sizes for maximum profit potential.

Moneyline
A bet on which team will win outright, with no point spread involved.

O
Odds
The numerical representation of an event’s probability and payout. Sharp Shot supports American, decimal, and fractional odds formats.

Over/Under (Totals)
A bet on whether the combined score of both teams will be over or under the posted total.

P
Parlay
A single wager combining two or more selections. All must win for the bet to pay out. Sharp Shot evaluates parlay legs individually for value before combining.

Preset
A saved Sharp Shot filter configuration that instantly displays bets matching your criteria. Can be private, shared with collaborators, or made public.

Push
A tied result between the bettor and sportsbook, returning the stake.

R
Return on Investment (ROI)
The percentage of profit relative to the amount wagered.

Round Robin
Multiple parlays generated from a larger list of selections, allowing partial wins.

S

The number of points by which a favorite must win or an underdog must stay within to cover.

Stake
The amount risked on a single wager.

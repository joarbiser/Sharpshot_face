Goal
Make both hero CTAs (“Get Started” and “See How It Works”) feel minimal and techy. Replace the chunky filled buttons with a shared “chip” component: transparent surface, thin outline, pill shape, subtle interactive states. Primary uses the accent token; secondary uses the neutral token. No heavy shadows.

Turn both CTAs into the same component
• Create a base class for both buttons (name it something like chip-btn).
• Apply the same height, padding, radius, outline, and transitions to both so they look like one system component.
• Add two modifiers: primary (for “Get Started”) and secondary (for “See How It Works”).

Base/idle state (what it looks like before hover)
• Surface: transparent.
• Border: 1px hairline outline using the appropriate design token (accent for primary, neutral for secondary).
• Text and icon: use the same token as the outline (so they read as a single “ink” color).
• Shape: pill (fully rounded ends).
• No drop shadow at all.
• Cursor: pointer on hover-capable devices.
• Hit target: make sure the visual height meets an accessible tap target; don’t rely on extra invisible padding.

Hover state (subtle, modern)
• Keep the outline; brighten it slightly.
• Fade in a very low-opacity fill inside the pill (same token family as the outline). This is a whisper, not a full solid—just enough to feel interactive.
• Add a tiny micro-movement to the leading icon on the primary only: slide it horizontally by ~2–3px; text stays still.
• Transition timing: ~150–200ms ease-out for border/fill; icon slide matches the same duration.
• No glow, no drop shadow, no looping shimmer.

Press/active state
• While pressed, scale the whole chip down very slightly (about 98%) and restore on release.
• Keep border/fill visible so the state change feels immediate without being flashy.

Focus-visible (keyboard)
• Do not add a big outer halo. Instead, show a 1px inner focus ring inside the outline using the same color family; it should be clearly visible against the background but not loud.
• The ring should not change layout or size.

Disabled and loading
• Disabled: reduce contrast/opacity, remove pointer events, and disable transitions/animations.
• Loading: replace the leading icon with a small spinner; keep the button width fixed so nothing shifts while it loads.

Icons
• Add a small leading icon component to both buttons for consistency (e.g., an arrow/play for primary, an eye or info for secondary).
• Only the primary icon moves on hover; the secondary icon stays stationary.
• Keep icon size consistent with your current system; don’t change font or size tokens.

Variants and tokens (no hardcoded colors)
• Use existing design tokens: “accent” for the primary outline/text/fill and “neutral” for the secondary.
• Do not introduce new color values; respect the site’s token names and current theme.
• Text uses the same token as its outline; the low-opacity hover fill is the same token with reduced alpha.

Motion preferences
• Respect reduced motion: if the user prefers reduced motion, remove the scale and icon slide. Keep color/alpha changes only.

Layout / spacing in the hero
• Keep both chips on one row with a consistent gap between them on desktop.
• On smaller screens, stack them with the same vertical gap.
• No layout shift when states change (hover/press/loading/disabled).

Semantics and links
• If these are links, keep them as anchors; if they trigger actions, use real <button> elements.
• Ensure accessible names and focus order are correct.
• “See How It Works” can link to the explainer section ID; “Get Started” goes to the sign-up/onboarding.

Clean-up checklist
• Remove any existing shadows or thick fills from the old buttons.
• Ensure both CTAs now share the same base class so future changes apply to both.
• Confirm the primary reads as the stronger action purely through token choice (accent vs neutral), not size or weight.

Net effect
You’ll end up with two sleek “command chips” that match the rest of the interface: transparent by default, precise outline, a quiet fill on hover, a tiny icon nudge on the primary, and crisp focus and press states. They feel interactive and modern without adding visual weight.

Sharp Shot — Home Page Blurb Animations (Fade + Slide-Up)
Objective
Make key blurbs smoothly appear as the user scrolls: they start slightly lower and transparent, then fade in while sliding up into place. Clean, premium, no gimmicks.

Where to apply on the home page
Apply this effect to these elements only:

Section headline: Who We Are

Paragraph under Who We Are

Gold pull-quote/tagline line (below that section)

Section headline: See Sharp Shot in Action

Paragraph under See Sharp Shot in Action

Any short supporting blurbs further down the page (features, proof points, etc.), but not to large hero text that’s already visible on load.

Trigger behavior
The animation should start when the element enters the viewport by ~20% of its height.

Elements animate once and stay visible (do not re-animate when scrolling back up).

On page load, do not pre-animate anything above the fold; only animate items as they cross the trigger.

Motion details
Start state: opacity 0 and translated 16px downward.

End state: opacity 1 and 0px translate (original position).

Duration: 0.6s per element.

Easing: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) (fast out, smooth finish).

Stagger (when multiple blurbs inside the same section): 120ms between each child, in source order.

Scroll detection
Use an Intersection Observer with:

rootMargin: "0px 0px -20% 0px" (or threshold ~0.2)

once: true behavior (disconnect or unobserve after animating each element).

Reduced motion
Respect users who prefer reduced motion:

If prefers-reduced-motion: reduce is detected, skip transforms and set blurbs to visible immediately (opacity 1, no translate).

Still keep the same spacing/layout.

Performance constraints
No heavy libraries for this; native Intersection Observer only.

Avoid layout thrash: use transform + opacity only.

Batch reads/writes if needed; but given the small count of blurbs, simple is fine.

Ensure animations run at 60fps on mid-range laptops.

Visual polish
The blurbs should not “pop” in. They must feel like they’re easing into focus.

No bounce, no overshoot, no color shifts.

Keep copy legible during the motion (no blur or filter).

Edge cases
If a blurb is already fully in view on initial load (e.g., due to a small screen), animate it immediately with a 100ms delay to avoid a harsh pop.

If the same blurb gets dynamically reinserted, it should be initialized again in the hidden state and observe the same rules.

Test checklist (acceptance criteria)
Scrolling down: each targeted blurb fades from 0 → 1 and slides 16px → 0 exactly once.

Scrolling back up: already-animated blurbs stay visible; no replays.

With reduced motion enabled at the OS level: blurbs are visible immediately; no movement.

No CLS (layout shift) introduced by the animation.

Frame rate stays smooth; no jank spikes around animation start.

Works on Chrome, Safari, Firefox (desktop and mobile).

Implementation notes for the dev
Mark each target element with a single, reusable attribute so we can add/remove animations easily later (example: data-animate="fade-up").

The base CSS should define the hidden state (opacity 0, translateY 16px). A single “in-view” class (example: .in-view) should switch it to opacity 1 and translateY 0 with the timing/easing above.

For stagger: when a section container is marked as “in view,” apply incremental delays to its child elements (e.g., via inline style or nth-child delay rules).

Disconnect each observed element after it animates to keep observers light.

That’s it. Build exactly like this on the home page and we’ll get the premium feel without slowing anything down.

The hero is muddy and over-saturated. Fix the background + glass card to match the Zenso-style spec.

Base layer (behind everything)

Keep a very dark neutral base with a soft radial vignette (very subtle).

Place exactly 3 blurred circular gradients, partially off-canvas, not touching text:
• Left/bottom: Sharp Shot neon green (largest)
• Right/top: Sharp Shot gold (medium)
• Center/back: neutral support circle (smallest) to add depth

Circle settings (apply to all): blur 80–140px, opacity 10–18%, no hard edges, no banding, no visible ring.

Position so no circle sits directly behind body text; they should frame, not wash out content.

Logo motif (left)

Reduce the logo mark scale by ~35–45% in the hero.

Drop its fill opacity to 6–10% and remove any inner glow.

Push it further left and down so it doesn’t collide with the hero card. It should read as background texture, not focal art.

Glass hero card

Use a translucent glass fill (dark mode variant). Increase backdrop blur to the mid-teens; decrease card fill opacity slightly so it looks “glass,” not gray.

Add a thin light hairline border and a faint top-edge inner highlight; remove heavy outer glow.

Shadow: soft and short (no big spread).

Corner radius: generous, but not bubbly.

Text contrast & hierarchy

Title uses “ink” (high-contrast light). Subhead uses “muted.”

Ensure the background immediately behind text is the quietest area (no circles centered behind text).

Increase card padding so the title doesn’t sit near the card edge or any glow.

Accent usage

Keep Sharp Shot gold only on the emphasized word in the title and on micro details (focus ring/underline).

Use Sharp Shot neon green ONLY for positive/“edge” indicators (not the title).

Remove all large gold fills or halos behind the hero card.

Buttons

Primary: dark fill, thin Sharp Shot gold outline. On hover, run a subtle outline sweep; no fill flood.

Secondary: dark fill or transparent with hairline border; no glow.

Increase button contrast vs card by slightly reducing local background intensity under the buttons.

Motion & performance

Disable any heavy glow animations. If we keep a “ticker” shimmer on the base, opacity ≤ 1% with a very long loop.

Add reduced-motion support: turn off shimmer and scale/translate on hover.

Layout checks

Ensure z-index: base backdrop < gradient circles < logo motif < glass card < text/buttons.

Keep circles at least 24–32px away from text bounding boxes on all breakpoints.

Test at 1440/1280/390 widths for overlap and readability.

Acceptance criteria

Title passes contrast (AA+) with the final card.

No color glow bleeds through the headline.

The glass reads translucent (you can sense the shapes behind it), but the text remains crisp.

The hero feels like “dark terminal + floating glass + soft shapes,” not “glow everywhere.”

Apply the same rules to light mode:

Base becomes off-white neutral; circles stay gold / neon green / soft neutral, but opacity drops ~20% compared to dark.

Glass card becomes semi-opaque white with blur a few px lower than dark mode; hairline border becomes subtle cool gray.

Keep the same accent rules for gold/green and the same no-glow policy.

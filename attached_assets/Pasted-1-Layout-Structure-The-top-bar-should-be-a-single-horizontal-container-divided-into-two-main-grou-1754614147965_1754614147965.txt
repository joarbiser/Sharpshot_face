1. Layout & Structure
The top bar should be a single horizontal container divided into two main groups:

Left-aligned: Sharp Shot logo (clickable to homepage) + “Product” dropdown menu.

Right-aligned: Pricing link, Resources link, Sign In button, Get Started Free button.

The bar should have 64px height on desktop and slightly shorter (56px) on mobile/tablet.

Background color: White.

A thin 1px bottom border in Sharp Shot gold should run across the full width.

Padding: 32px left/right on desktop, 20px on tablet, 16px on mobile.

2. Product Dropdown
“Product” should be clickable on mobile and hoverable on desktop to open a dropdown.

Dropdown contents:

Trading Terminal

Preset Terminal

(Leave room for future tools)

Dropdown styling:

White background, rounded corners, subtle box-shadow.

Links inside the dropdown have padding of about 10px vertical, 16px horizontal.

On hover, the link background changes to a light Sharp Shot gold tint with charcoal text.

Include a small down-arrow icon next to the “Product” text. When the dropdown is active/open, rotate the arrow 180 degrees.

3. Navigation Links
Links (Pricing, Resources) should have:

Default: Charcoal text, medium weight.

Hover: Sharp Shot gold text and/or thin Sharp Shot gold underline.

Active page: Persistent Sharp Shot gold underline and Sharp Shot gold text.

Keep spacing between links consistent — minimum of 32px between each on desktop.

4. Logo
Logo height: 28px on desktop, 24px on tablet/mobile.

It should be vertically aligned with the nav links.

The clickable area around the logo should be slightly larger than the image for better tapping on mobile.

5. Buttons
Sign In button:

White background, charcoal text, charcoal border.

On hover, border changes to Sharp Shot gold and text changes to Sharp Shot gold.

Slight rounding of corners (around 6px radius).

Get Started Free button:

Sharp Shot gold background, charcoal text, bold font weight.

Slightly larger than the Sign In button, but not oversized.

On hover, background changes to a darker shade of Sharp Shot gold, with a slight scale-up animation and subtle shadow.

6. Sticky & Scroll Behavior
The navigation bar should remain sticky at the top of the screen when scrolling.

When in sticky mode, a subtle drop shadow should appear underneath to give a floating effect.

7. Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness
On smaller screens:

Replace nav links with a hamburger menu icon.

Keep the logo on the left and the Get Started Free button visible on the right.

Hamburger menu opens a vertical slide-out containing:

Product (collapsible with Trading Terminal & Preset Terminal links)

Pricing

Resources

Sign In

All touch targets in mobile mode should be at least 44px high.

8. Interaction Feedback
All links, buttons, and dropdown triggers should have pointer cursor on hover.

Dropdown should animate in smoothly (slight fade and slide) rather than appearing instantly.

Hover states and animations should have a transition duration of about 0.2s for smoothness.

9. Accessibility
Navigation should be fully usable via keyboard:

Tab key moves through links and buttons in a logical order.

Dropdown opens with Enter or Space.

Add proper ARIA attributes to the dropdown trigger:

aria-haspopup="true"

aria-expanded toggles true/false when opened or closed.
